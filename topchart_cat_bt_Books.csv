As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.

عَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة.",2016-06-04T13:35:31Z,2024-09-19T14:14:26Z
