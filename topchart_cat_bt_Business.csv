Deputy will even automatically remind employees of their shifts on the morning that they are due to work.

Manage employees’ leave requests or unavailability from a central location, then integrate with your online rotas so there’s no risk of scheduling someone who is not available.

Need to be smart about staffing levels? Deputy integrates with your POS and payroll information to make sure you’re scheduling efficiently, and pulls in real-time weather information so you know if you need extra shifts or not!

Clocking in to work is made simple with our time clock software, including GPS validation, to quickly track time and attendance (or optionally from a tablet Kiosk, using our inbuilt facial detection technology).

Finalising your timesheets and exporting to payroll can be done with one click from your mobile device.
