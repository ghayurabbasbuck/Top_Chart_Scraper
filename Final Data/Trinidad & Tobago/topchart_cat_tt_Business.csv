Review from eCommerce News HQ
“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“

Review from David B via g2.com
“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”

Create and send invoices however you'd like
You get to choose from over 18 professional invoice templates and customize the tables, fonts, colors, fields, and more. The invoices can be sent directly to the customer's email inbox or downloaded as a PDF invoice, which can be shared via iMessage or WhatsApp.

Connect your Zoho Invoice account to a payment gateway and give your customers the flexibility to pay with their preferred payment modes. Upon payment, invoices are automatically marked as ""paid"" in Zoho Invoice.

Your payment follow-ups are on autopilot
Configure automated payment reminders to follow up with customers for overdue invoices. You have full control over when the payment reminders are sent and can customize the emails as you'd like.

Get better deals with estimates Use Zoho Invoice's estimates to negotiate with customers and close deals. Customers can view, discuss, reject, and approve estimates. Approved estimates are automatically converted into invoices.

Work on hour-based projects with time tracking
If you're a freelancer or small business where you charge customers based on total hours spent on the project, you can use Zoho Invoice to track time and convert timesheets into invoices.

A simplified and elevated customer experience
Your customers are empowered with a portal where they can log in with a user ID and password. Here, they can view credits, approve and reject estimates, pay invoices, download customer statements, and drop feedback.

Track every penny that leaves your business's pockets
All these capabilities aside, Zoho Invoice is also your friendly business expense tracking app. Record unbillable expenses like rent and maintenance. Also, record billable expenses like raw material costs and get reimbursed by customers.
