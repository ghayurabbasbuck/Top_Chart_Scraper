5- Keep giving words and talking until someone thinks they've figured it out.

Fun, fast, and full of suspicion—perfect for game nights, road trips, or hanging out with friends.

- Play locally with 3 to 15 friends
- 10+ categories like food, movies, jobs, and more
- 500+ unique words and growing
- No accounts, no setup—just start playing
