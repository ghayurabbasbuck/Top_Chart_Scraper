With Circles, you can create a group of people who share their locations within the group, so you can easily track their location history and current location. Invite members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number, and once they accept the invitation, you can locate them on the map at any time.

The app also includes geofence zones, which allow you to know when any of your circle members enter or leave a certain area by creating a location-based boundary. You can drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geofence at a specific location, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and get push notifications when someone enters or exits it. This feature can help you ensure that your loved ones are safe by automatically letting you know their whereabouts, without any effort from them.

In case of emergencies, the app includes an SOS function that sends an urgent push notification to all members of your circle when you tap on the SOS button, along with a live update of your location. This feature ensures that your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they need help or are in danger.

Other features of the app include the ability to view the location history of each circle member, find a lost device using the GPS phone tracker, and manage group circles and geofence zones.

Phone Tracker is your reliable GPS-based family locator and personal tracking app, designed to help keep your loved ones safe. It is not intended for spying or secret surveillance, and it cannot be installed remotely or without consent. To use the service, the user must install the app manually and approve the location-sharing request. By subscribing you can enjoy unlimited alerts, real-time tracking, extended location history and many more features!
