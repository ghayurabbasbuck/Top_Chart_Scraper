This is the simplest-to-use contraction timer. The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.
If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.

Not too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.
- Track your pregnancy journey. Get weekly insights on pregnancy symptoms, learn how to read ultrasound scans, monitor contractions, and keep track of your baby’s movements with a kick counter.

For best results:

- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.
- Use the app in a quiet room
- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)
- Put the phone in Airplane Mode
- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press ""Record"" to create a recording
- Use AirPods
