Forget boring flashcards and endless Google searches. Studley AI is your personal AI homework helper, AI note taker, and AI tutor. Built for students who want insane results. Whether you’re trying to keep a 4.0 GPA or just trying to pass with less stress, Studley is the smartest way to study.

Turn anything into a Study Set:
Upload your lecture slides, textbook chapter, YouTube video, PDF, or even an article link, and Studley instantly turns it into a fully editable Study Set. 

A Study Set can include:

- Flashcards (perfect for memorization)
- Multiple-choice quizzes (test your recall fast)
- Fill-in-the-blanks (strengthen active recall)
- Written tests (practice full answers)
- Tutor mode (AI explains concepts like a personal teacher)

Every question is automatically tagged (e.g., unfamiliar, learning, familiar, mastered) so you can track progress in real time. You’ll literally see your weak spots disappear as you move questions into higher mastery levels.

Progress tracking that actually works:


Our system uses Active Recall and spaced repetition to make sure you remember what you learn long term. No more rereading notes 10 times. Studley forces your brain to work with memory science, not against it. You’ll walk into every exam feeling like you’ve already taken it.

The Solve Tab – Instant Answers, Step-by-Step:


Got a tough homework problem or confusing question? Just take a pic in the Solve tab, and Studley’s AI gives you step-by-step explanations. Not just the answer. This is your 24/7 tutor that never judges you for asking “dumb” questions.

Why Studley AI beats Quizlet (and everything else):

- Smarter AI – You’re not stuck with generic flashcards; every question is made from your content.
- Tagging system – Quizlet can’t show you exactly which questions you’ve mastered vs. which still trip you up. Studley can.
- Fully editable – Change, add, or delete anything. Make it 100% your style.
- All-in-one – No switching between apps for notes, practice tests, and tutors. It’s all here.
- Built for the students who actually want to win.

Studley is powered by proven study methods like:

- Active Recall – Forces you to retrieve info from memory, which strengthens retention.
- Spaced Repetition – Keeps reviewing just before you forget, so it sticks forever.
- Bloom’s Taxonomy – Helps you move beyond memorization into deeper understanding.
- Feynman Technique – Makes sure you can explain concepts clearly, not just repeat them.

How students are using Studley to get a 4.0 GPA:

- Prepping for finals in half the time by turning whole courses into Study Sets.
- Using the tagging system to focus only on “unfamiliar” questions until they’re mastered.
- Swapping Quizlet for Studley to have AI generate better practice questions from any content.
- Getting AI tutoring on hard topics without paying $50/hour.

Why you’ll never go back to old-school studying:

- Fast – Turn any material into a Study Set in seconds.
- Personalized – Tags + progress tracking keep you working only on what matters.
- Affordable – All the features of a private tutor, without the price.
- Proven – Based on real memory science, not gimmicks.

Unlock reading and writing potential with the literacy programme designed for kids and trusted by teachers worldwide. Aligned with the Science of Reading, this interactive app makes learning to read and write and building phonemic awareness fun and engaging!

What is Jolly Phonics?
Jolly Phonics is a programme for teaching reading and writing. It is based on a systematic synthetic phonics approach, and was developed by teachers Sue Lloyd and Sara Wernham. It is the first stage in teaching children to read and write using the 5 key skills. It focuses on direct, explicit instruction of phonemic awareness and phonics for both reading (decoding) and writing (encoding). Scientific research has consistently shown phonemic awareness to be essential for building strong reading, spelling and writing skills.

Why Choose Jolly Phonics?
1. Proven Success: Used in schools globally for over 30 years with proven literacy outcomes.
2. Science-Based Approach: Aligned with the Science of Reading to ensure kids build effective foundational reading and spelling skills.
3. Engaging and Multi-Sensory: Songs, actions and interactive learning games bring phonics learning to life!

Key Features That Make Learning Easy and Fun:
1. Explore All 42 Letter Sounds: Go beyond ABC with free songs and audio to help kids learn every sound.
2. Learn to Read: Build phonemic awareness with our interactive learning tools such as flashcards, wordbank and action images to enhance and support every lesson.
3. Learn to Write: Develop strong handwriting skills with step-by-step visual animations.
4. Learning Games: Learn to read and write with fun phonics learning games that reinforce kids' learning.
5. Progress Tracking: Built-in assessments to monitor children's progress and celebrate achievements.

Who Is Jolly Phonics For?
1. Kids: From preschoolers learning their first words and ABC, to confident young readers building their phonics skills.
2. Parents: Support your children's early reading, writing, and spelling journey at home with our guided lessons.
3. Teachers: A valuable classroom resource for phonics instruction.

Start Your Kids' Phonics Journey Today!
Join the millions of families and educators who have embraced the Jolly Phonics programme of learning for confident readers and writers. Whether at home or in the classroom, this app makes literacy learning simple, effective and enjoyable!

Why Phonics Instead of ABC?
1. Phonics focuses on letter-sound relationships and how sounds (phonemes) make up words. It teaches kids the valuable skill of decoding, which is essential for reading and spelling fluency.
2. ABC refers to learning letters and their names rather than their sounds. Knowing the alphabet may be a precursor to phonics but doesn't directly teach reading skills.

Learning Beyond ABC!
Jolly Phonics doesn't stop at just ABC or phonemic awareness. The app offers:
1. Advanced learning strategies
2. Comprehensive handwriting exercises
3. Fun learning games designed for children to reinforce spelling and letter sounds knowledge

Start Your Kids' Phonics Journey Today!
Join the millions of families and educators who have embraced the Jolly Phonics programme of learning for confident readers and writers.
