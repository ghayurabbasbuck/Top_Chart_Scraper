What our users say:

“Best bible to read from. This is the most aesthetically pleasing bible to read from. Simple, smooth, and I like how you can scroll through a book and the titles of each section to find a story, event, or the account that you are looking for. Especially like the breakdown of Strong's number and definitions of each word in a verse which allows you to study the whole verse in one quick, convenient fatal sweep... and get cross references and Matthew Henry's take on it... all in one place! Awesome!” -- Seen003, Apr 9, 2012 

“Excellent Bible App!!!! - I have used a number of the Bible apps available...and find this new version to be my favorite! What I really like: closest look/feel to a paper Bible (the fonts and layout is the most realistic I've seen), when highlighting a verse or section you get not only a ""copy"" function, but direct access to the commentaries, references to the Strong's concordance, and cross-references that make this Bible a really viable study tool, as well! Also, the Bible versions are robust enough for almost all users, with downloadable versions...Bottom-line...this Bible App has, IMHO, moved into the forefront in this category! At the price...who can say ""no"" to at least trying it, if not making it the one you go to for Bible reading and study!?!?” -- MacTombo, Nov 29, 2011",2011-11-02T15:27:22Z,2021-02-15T17:34:36Z
