You can write small snippets of Python code and observe the result on screen, combine with paragraphs of text, using Markdown.

Carnets provides a complete, stand-alone, implementation of Jupyter notebooks. Everything runs on your device, using the embedded Python interpreter; you do not need an internet connection. You can chose between Jupyter notebooks and the more advance Jupyterlab using Settings.

Numpy, Sympy, Matplotlib, Pandas, lxml, bokeh, nbextensions (including ipywidgets) and many other packages are pre-installed. To see the full list of installed packages, type ""%pip list"" in a code window. You can add more packages using ""%pip install packageName"", but only if they are pure Python.

If you need scipy, seaborn or scikit-learn, please use our other App, ""Carnets - Jupyter (with scipy)"".

You can share your notebooks with other apps and also open notebooks or directories managed by other apps.
