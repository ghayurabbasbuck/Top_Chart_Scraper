ee,Estonia,Education,6017,14,1475639110,ALPA harivad mängud lastele,ALPA Kids OU,https://apps.apple.com/ee/app/alpa-harivad-m%C3%A4ngud-lastele/id1475639110?uo=4,0.0,4.61064,1654,Education,"ALPA Kids loob koostöös haridustehnoloogide ja lasteaednikega mobiilimänge, mis pakuvad 3-8aastastele Eesti ja Välis-Eesti lastele võimalust õppida numbreid, tähestikku, kujundeid, Eesti loodust jpm eesti keeles ning läbi kohaliku kultuuri ja looduse näidete.


* HARIDUSLIK SISU
ALPA mängud on loodud koostöös õpetajate ja haridustehnoloogidega. Pedagoogilisi suuniseid annavad ka Tallinna Ülikooli teadurid.

* EAKOHANE
Eakohasuse tagamiseks on mängud jagatud nelja raskusastmesse. Tasemetele ei ole määratud täpset vanust, sest laste oskused ja huvid on erinevad.

* PERSONAALNE  
ALPA mängudes on kõik võitjad, sest iga laps jõuab rõõmustavate õhupallideni omas tempos ja enda oskustele vastavas tasemes.

* SUUNAMINE EKRAANIVÄLISTELE TEGEVUSTELE
Mängud on lõimitud ekraaniväliste tegevustega, et laps harjuks juba varakult ekraani tagant pause tegema. Samuti on hea õpitut kohe korrata seoses muu ümbritsevaga. Lisaks kutsub ALPA lapsi õppemängude vahel tantsima!

* NUTIKATE FUNKTSIOONIDEGA
  - Internetivaba kasutus:
Rakendus on kasutatav ka ilma internetita, et laps ei saaks nutiseadmes liigselt rändama minna.

  - Soovituste süsteem:
Rakendus teeb anonüümsete kasutusmustrite põhjal järeldusi lapse oskuste kohta ja soovitab sobivaid mänge. 
 
  - Kõneaeglusti:
Alpa võib panna automaatse kõneaeglusti abil aeglasemalt rääkima. See funktsioon on eriti populaarne väliseestlaste ja muukeelsete laste seas!
 
  - Ajavõtt:
Laps vajab lisamotivatsiooni? Siis võiks talle sobida ajavõtt, kus ta saab enda rekordeid purustada üha uuesti ja uuesti!

* TURVALINE
ALPA rakendus ei kogu teie pere isikuandmeid ja ei tegele andmemüügiga. Samuti ei sisalda rakendus reklaame, sest me ei pea seda eetiliseks.

* SISU AINA LISANDUB
ALPA rakenduses on juba üle 80 mängu tähestikust, numbritest, lindudest ja loomadest. Iga kuu lisame uut sisu!
 
Tasulisest tellimusest:


* AUS HINNASTUS
Nagu öeldakse “kui sa toote eest ei maksa, siis oled sa ise toode”. Tõsi on, et paljud mobiilirakendused on justkui tasuta, kuid tegelikkuses teenivad nemad reklaami ja andmemüügi pealt. Meie aga eelistame ausat hinnastust.
 
* PALJU ROHKEM SISU
Tasulise tellimusega on rakenduses oluliselt rohkem sisu! Lausa sadu uusi teadmisi! 

* PERSONALISEERITUD ÕPE JA ÕPIANALÜÜTIKA
ALPA pakub personaalset õpikogemust soovitades just lapse oskustele vastavat sisu. Rakendus aitab õpianalüütikaga jälgida ka lapse arengut.
 
* SISALDAB UUSI MÄNGE
Hind sisaldab ka igakuiseid uusi mänge. Tulge jälgima, mida uut ja põnevat me arendame!
 
* LISAB ÕPIMOTIVATSIOONI
Tasulise tellimuse puhul saab rakendada ajavõtmise võimalust ehk laps saab purustada enda ajalisi rekordeid ja õpimotivatsiooni üleval hoida.
 
* TOETAD EESTI KEELT
Toetad uute eestikeelsete mängude loomist ja seeläbi ka eesti keele säilimist.


Ettepanekud ja küsimused on igati teretulnud!

WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT US?

“You actually learn fun math facts and fill gaps when you compulsively reach for your phone. Useful app!” — KellyR.

“Hands-on app to improve your financial literacy, the lessons are practical and fun!” — AlvesT.

“This app has taught me how to understand abstract art. It’s truly eye-opening and easy to digest.” — Josel.P

“Nibble is top-notch to learn on the go! I like the probability lesson, it’s really practical and easy to follow.” — Isikatony

""The lessons are quick, fun (the Egyptian section with the tweets between the gods made me and my 12-year-old chuckle), clever - and genuinely interesting. My kid and I will go through lessons together - it’s interesting enough to keep his attention, and I’m learning new things too. Not too advanced for him, or remedial for me. I’ve enjoyed all the lessons - logic (the infinite hotel theory was great), art, math, and history. It is indeed much more enjoyable than doom scrolling. I encourage you to take a chance, I’m hooked. Please keep the new lessons coming!"" — BustedKate

HOW DOES IT WORK?

After you decide to learn with Nibble and download the app, you can choose a subscription plan most suitable for your goals.

The Nibble subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each month, 3 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the selected option) until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal will be disabled. However, you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period.

If you start a free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial.

Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.
