Along with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.

Through our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.

**The I Am Sober app features:**

To visualize how long you’ve been sober.

• Remember why you quit
Add reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.

• Sobriety calculator
View how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.

• Analyze triggers
Recap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.

Track and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.

• Withdrawal timeline
When you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.

• Customize your experience
You set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.

Of course, we understand that switching to a new app can be annoying, but we promise: handling your smart lights is even easier with SMART+ from now!
To show you what to expect, we have summarized the smart features for you below:
Flexible lighting
A flexible lighting mode allows you to adjust brightness, color temperature or even the colors of your smart lights according to your respective needs. You can set different moods thanks to pre-installed light scenes but an individual modification is also possible.
Schedules & Automations
With the help of the new SMART+ app, you can set up different schedules and automations: You are watching TV at the same time every day and want to switch off the ceiling light to do so? No problem! Once set, your smart devices will automatically repeat this action every day by themselves.
Smart lighting for your daily routine & circadian rhythm
Whether waking up in the morning or going to bed in the evening – with some of the LEDVANCE products you can easily define a sunrise alarm with fade-in or fade-out lighting via app. Also super helpful: Light similar to natural daylight can help improve physical well-being. Based on this scientific finding, you can adjust the light color and brightness of certain luminaires to your individual daily routine - for calmer sleep and a better mood.
Adaptation to light conditions
If the sun is shining, you usually need little to no additional light. If it is cloudy, on the other hand, artificial light is needed to brighten up the room. By linking to weather information, your lighting independently adjusts to the current natural lighting conditions.
Integration with other smart home systems
Do you already use Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, Home Connect Plus or Amazon Alexa? The combination of the SMART+ app with these systems offers you additional features for many end devices - for example, voice control. The app even supports 27 languages here.
Grouping lamps
With the new SMART+ app, it is possible to organize several lamps into groups and control them simultaneously. For example, you can set all your outdoor lights to turn on together.
Power consumption 
If you use Wifi sockets for your smart lighting or other devices, you can view the energy consumption at any time with the help of our app – that's good for the environment and your wallet!
Solar lights control
Solar lights usually turn on by themselves. However, our smart solar products can also be conveniently controlled using the new SMART+ app.
Camera and sensor control
Do you use smart outdoor lights with integrated cameras or sensors? Thanks to the SMART+ app, you'll receive live images and notifications when your lights detect movement.
Music function
With the help of the app and integrated voice receivers, some lights respond to sound and music – so the next party will be great!
Integration of non-smart devices into the system
You want to control a non-smart light via our app? Thanks to the SMART+ Plug, even conventional lights and devices can be integrated into your smart home system and controlled via the SMART+ app.
Note: Please note that some functions of the app only work with WiFi or Bluetooth devices. Zigbee devices are not compatible with this app.
As you can see, the new SMART+ app offers many functions around smart lighting and beyond. The future belongs to smart home systems. LEDVANCE therefore offers you a wide range of smart lighting solutions for indoors and outdoors to pair with the app. These solutions are not only extremely efficient, but also visually appealing . Whether smart ceiling lights, LED lamps or LED strips –  at SMART+ you will surely find what you are looking for.",2023-07-04T07:00:00Z,2025-10-31T10:06:00Z
