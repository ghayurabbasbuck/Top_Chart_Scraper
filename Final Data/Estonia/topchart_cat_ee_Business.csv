Smart-ID allows you to give signatures equal to handwritten signatures (except Basic level), which complies with EU regulations about qualified electronic signatures.

Smart-ID is currently available for:
-	Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian residents
-	Estonian e-residents
-	Belgium residents


EASY 
Get started by downloading Smart-ID app.

Follow the steps in the app to confirm your identity and complete the registration process. Once you’ve done that, you’re good to go – no other confirmation needed! 

CONVENIENT
Your Smart-ID is always within an easy reach!

You can use Smart-ID in as many smart devices as you want and gain access to your online accounts across all of them any time, any place. Using Smart-ID is free and totally unlimited.

SAFE

Smart-ID app does not store your identity or PIN codes. The app is used for key management: it creates your private keys while account registration and later mediates authentication and signature requests. User identity is managed securely by the service provider. A technology has been used in this product for which Cybernetica AS has filed a patent application or a patent has been granted.
