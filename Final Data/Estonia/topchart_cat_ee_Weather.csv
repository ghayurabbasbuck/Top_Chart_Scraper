The app was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions.

With information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan.


▼　All the information you need, in one app

Get a wide range of disaster prevention information, including weather and typhoon forecasts, rain radar, earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption alerts, emergency weather warnings and landslide information, river information, and heavy rain risk notifications.

By interacting with the map on the screen, you can zoom in on your location or pan across the country and see the cloud cover, typhoon forecast areas, tsunami warning areas, or the scale and intensity of an earthquake.


①　Providing users with the most appropriate disaster information

The home screen displays the information you need at the time and place you need it. When there’s an earthquake, the home screen will show you the latest information. If another type of warning or alert is issued while the earthquake is active, the app will sort them depending on the type, elapsed time and urgency, so you’ll always have the most important information at your fingertips.


②　Push Notifications for Important Information

We send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes.

Note: Critical Alerts will only be sent to users in the target area of the most urgent types of disasters. Users who have registered their location but are not in the target area will instead receive a normal notification.

※ In order to receive Critical Alerts, you need to set your location permissions to “Always Allow” and have Background App Refresh turned on. If you don’t want Critical Alerts, you can disable them from Settings.


③　Barrier-Free Design

We paid close attention when designing the app to ensure our information is accessible to everyone. We put a focus on accessibility, with colour schemes that are easy to distinguish for people with colour blindness, and use a font with large, clear letters so long bodies of text are easy to read.


▼　Supporters’ Club (In-App Purchase)

In order to keep doing what we do, we’re looking for supporters to help us cover the development and operational costs of the app. The Supporters’ Club is a voluntary membership scheme for those who want to give back to the NERV Disaster Prevention app, by contributing to its development with a monthly fee.

You can find out more information about the Supporters’ Club on our website.

ee,Estonia,Weather,6001,24,6749782053,AuroraMe: Aurora Forecast Live,Nikolai Iakubovskii,https://apps.apple.com/ee/app/aurorame-aurora-forecast-live/id6749782053?uo=4,0.0,3,2,Weather,"AuroraMe — Know when to look up, not by luck

AuroraMe turns live space-weather and local sky conditions into a clear aurora forecast for tonight, with real-time alerts, KP index, NOAA/Ovation data, and a visibility map near you.

Why AuroraMe
- Built for ""northern lights tonight"" decisions — see None / Possible / Likely / Visible at a glance.
- Actionable insights, not raw charts.
- Privacy-first by design.

What You Get
- Now: concise status with the factors that drive it.
- Best Time Tonight: the exact hour with the highest chance to see the northern lights.
- Live Map: Ovation oval, KP index, cloud cover, darkness, and moon phase combined into one aurora visibility map.
- Smart Alerts: notifications when visibility spikes near you; thresholds, cooldowns, and Quiet Hours prevent night spam.
- 3-Day & 27-Day Forecasts: short windows for chasing plus monthly trends for planning.
- Tracker Tools: probability, storm activity, and recent changes as conditions evolve.

How It Works
- Blends NOAA SWPC (Ovation, Kp), GFZ geomagnetic data, and local weather (Open-Meteo, MET Norway).
- Models cloud cover, darkness, lunar light, and magnetic latitude to estimate visibility and trigger alerts at the right moment.

Locations & Privacy
- Save places worldwide or tap Use Current Location once.
- Change or remove locations anytime.
- Location is accessed only on demand — no background tracking.

Plans
- Free: 1 location, up to 3 alerts/day, 20-minute updates, “Tonight” view up to 12 hours.
- Premium: up to 10 locations, real-time updates, 72-hour forecast, advanced smart alerts, full map layers.
- Manage subscriptions in-app; Restore Purchases available on the paywall.

Example
- Add Fairbanks or Tromsø and enable ""Likely Visible"" alerts with Quiet Hours 02:00–08:00 — you'll get notified when KP, darkness, and low clouds line up so you don’t miss the show.

Notes
- Aurora visibility depends on many natural factors and can’t be guaranteed.
- Data sources may have latency; we surface that when relevant.
