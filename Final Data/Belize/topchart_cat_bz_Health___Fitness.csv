Spirit Fast is your #1 Christian fasting app designed to help you humble your soul and live in total submission to the will of God for your life.

Spirit Fast app contains various fasting plans that are suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women. With the ability to add your fasting buddies, you’ll find the motivation and support you’re looking for. 
Spirit Fast was developed from the first principles of true Biblical Fasting— what the Bible teaches about fasting. It also based on the research made by influential Christian leaders including John Piper, Derek Prince, Jentezen Franklin and Pastor Vlad Savchuk. 
As a Christian, when was the last time you fasted? Jesus expects His followers to fast, and even promises it will happen. He doesn’t say “if,” but “when you fast” (Matt 6:16). And He doesn’t say His followers might fast, but “they will” (Matt 9:15). Spirit Fast Christian fasting app will help you make fasting not just a one-time act but a lifestyle.
Fasting removes the barriers to communication with God and allows the spirit man to commune directly with the heavenly Father – without disturbance.

How Life Reset Works

1. Personalized Program Generation
Start with a simple questionnaire about your current lifestyle. Life Reset creates a custom life reset plan focusing on six key areas: Sleep, Water, Exercise, Mind, Screen Time, and Shower Habits.

2. Gradual Challenge Increase
Each week, your tasks evolve — becoming slightly more challenging to help you grow and strengthen your daily routines.

3. Daily Reminders & Tasks
Every morning, Life Reset presents your daily tasks. Check them off by midnight and watch your progress unfold.

Why 66 Days?

Research shows that forming new habits takes about 66 days. Life Reset leverages this science-backed timeframe to help you build lasting, positive changes.
