Turn your iPhone or iPad into a live flight tracker and see planes around the world move in real-time on a detailed map.

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Does an eSIM come with a number?

- Digital nomads who need to stay connected to work while abroad.
- Crew members (e.g., seafarers, flight attendants, etc.) who need to stay connected while they travel.

Can I use my SIM card at the same time?
