Mated to Two Bad Boy Alphas

Amanda Stevens thought her problems were over when she got to college. No longer the shy, awkward teen she was in high school, Amanda felt this was her chance at making new friends and experiencing life. That was until she found out her high school Bully was attending the same college she was. Hudson Harlow. 
The moment that Hudson Harlow looked into the hazel eyes of Amanda Stevens, his wolf started to howl MATE! Why in the world would the Moon Goddess mate him to a human? But Hudson started to notice that this was no longer the girl that he tormented in High School. She'd changed. 
Hudson, knowing how awfully he treated Amanda in high school, had to now convince her to forgive him and accept him as her mate. 
Not only did Amanda have to deal with Hudson, but she also had to juggle her classes, a new job, and strange animal attacks on campus. All Amanda wanted was a normal college life.

His Broken Luna
Battered, abused, and broken, Sophia Alden is resigned to living the rest of her life as a slave to Alexander, a powerful Alpha who considers her his property and is dangerously obsessed with her. 
But when the Alpha of the most powerful pack comes to claim his true mate, hearts are broken, dangerous enemies are made, and Sophia finds herself thrust into a world of lies, lust, secrets, and desires that threatens to douse her in its burning flame, consuming her entire being.

bz,Belize,Books,6018,14,1473021827,Readmio: Kids Bedtime Stories,readmio s.r.o.,https://apps.apple.com/bz/app/readmio-kids-bedtime-stories/id1473021827?uo=4,0.0,4.5,2,Book,"Hundreds of enchanting stories brimming with surprises, entertainment, and wisdom, elevated by a captivating audio adventure for kids. When you read aloud, the app responds to your voice with delightful sounds and music. For a child, this is a wondrous audio journey, free from any screen time.

REASONS WHY YOU’LL LOVE READMIO
— We help build a positive attitude towards reading
— We create stories with the intention of supporting the mental and emotional development of children
— Our stories are short and easy to integrate with other activities
— Reading with sounds works offline and with your privacy in mind
— We add new stories every week
— It’s fun not only for your children but for you as well

LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS
— Stories and fairy tales also include audiobooks. This is handy when you can’t read or while driving.
— Your presence while listening to audiobooks has a positive effect. If you also maintain physical contact (holding hands, stroking the head), it’s even better.

CREATE YOUR OWN AUDIOBOOKS
— Each fairy tale or story you read aloud can be recorded and automatically transformed into your very own audiobook! With just one click.
— You can listen to the audiobooks while travelling in the car or children can listen to your voice when you are away.
— Audiobooks you create can be shared with your family or friends.

COLOURING AND MORE
— Stories include colouring pages you can print and let your children color them. It’s a great activity children can do while you read to them or the next day.
— You can also print any story and read it without the phone.

BY PARENTS FOR PARENTS
Readmio is an app full of fairy tales that we have enriched with sounds. Just download the app, save a story to the library and start reading! While you read out loud, the app follows along and adds sounds at exactly the right moment. You don’t have to worry about anything, just read at a regular speed and our application will listen to you and enhance your experience. That’s it. For best results, don’t read too fast and avoid noisy environments (e.g. in the car).

A SMALL THEATRE AT HOME
Feel free to put even more into the storytelling, our sounds and music will help you. For example, try making different voices or facial expressions and make a small home theater for your children. Your acting performance is very important for the whole experience. Some parents even prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker to make the sounds and music create a colorful atmosphere throughout the whole room.

WHY THERE AREN’T ANY ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STORIES?
The fairy tales have beautiful cover illustrations that will help you and your children choose what you are going to read. However, the children's contact with the mobile phone should end there. In the stories themselves, we did not include illustrations intentionally because we do not want to support their time spent in front of the screen. It is better to draw children's attention to you, the sounds, and the story itself.

MEANINGFUL STORIES
We created Readmio because we believe in the power of stories. They form the basis of society and help to spread and maintain wisdom. For children, they are an ideal tool not only for expanding vocabulary but also for explaining complicated topics. We recommend that you use our stories as a conversation starter for topics you care about. You will find inspiration on how to get started in the descriptions of the individual stories.

ABOUT PRIVACY
An internet connection is required to download the fairy tale, but not for the reading itself. Speech recognition works completely offline on your device. No data or voice recordings are stored or transferred anywhere. Your privacy comes first. In addition, you can read on the go or abroad without worrying about expensive roaming charges.

We believe that you and your little ones will enjoy the application and have many magical experiences together.",2020-12-25T08:00:00Z,2025-11-18T12:31:53Z

La Biblia, que es, los sacros libros del Viejo y Nuevo Testamento. Trasladada en español. La Palabra del Dios nuestro permanece para siempre. 1569, también conocida como la Biblia del Oso, es la primera traducción completa de la Biblia al español, publicada el 28 de septiembre de 1569. Su traductor fue Casiodoro de Reina. La Biblia del Oso es usualmente referida como Reina-Valera (RV) por haber hecho Cipriano de Valera la primera revisión de ella en 1602.
La Reina-Valera tuvo amplia difusión durante la Reforma Protestante del siglo XVI. Hoy en día, la Reina-Valera (con varias revisiones a través de los años) es una de las biblias en español más usadas por gran parte de las iglesias cristianas derivadas de la Reforma (incluyendo las iglesias evangélicas), así como por otros grupos de fe cristiana, como la Iglesia Adventista del Séptimo Día, La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días, los Gedeones Internacionales y otros cristianos no denominacionales.
Traducción de Reina
Casiodoro de Reina, monje jerónimo español del Monasterio de San Isidoro del Campo, tras partir al exilio para escapar de las persecuciones de la Inquisición, trabajó durante doce años en la traducción de la Biblia. La Biblia del Oso fue publicada en Basilea, Suiza. Es llamada Biblia del Oso por la ilustración en su portada de un oso que intenta alcanzar un panal de miel colgado de un árbol. Se colocó esa ilustración, logotipo del impresor bávaro Mattias Apiarius, en la portada para evitar el uso de íconos religiosos, porque en aquel tiempo estaba prohibida cualquier traducción de la Biblia a lenguas vernáculas.
La traducción del Antiguo Testamento, como lo declara expresamente Casiodoro de Reina en su “Amonestación del intérprete de los sacros libros al lector”, se basó en el texto masorético hebreo (edición de Bomberg, 1525). Como consideraba que la Vulgata latina ya había cumplido su papel y contenía errores y cambios, prefirió usar como fuente secundaria la traducción al latín de Sanctes Pagnino (Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio, 1528), porque “al voto de todos los doctos en la lengua hebraica es tenida por la más pura que hasta ahora hay”, corrigiendo la versión masorética cada vez que se aparta de las citas del Antiguo en el Nuevo Testamento. Tuvo siempre a mano para resolver las dudas la Biblia de Ferrara (Abraham Usque y Yom-Tob Athias, 1553), traducción del hebreo al judeoespañol usada por los judíos sefardíes, que Reina consideraba “obra de la mayor estima”, “por dar la natural y primera significación de los vocablos hebreos y las diferencias de los tiempos de los verbos”.
Para la traducción del Nuevo Testamento, Reina se basó en el Textus Receptus (Erasmo 1516, Stephanus, 1550), en la Políglota Complutense y en los mejores manuscritos griegos que en ese tiempo se conocían. Al parecer, tenía a la vista las versiones del Nuevo Testamento de Juan Pérez de Pineda de 1556, Francisco de Enzinas de 1543 y traducciones de Juan de Valdés.",2016-07-08T19:01:11Z,2025-06-09T06:20:36Z
