It has never been easier to share a wishlist than with the GoWish app. Share wishlists with your friends using the app, share via SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger, email, or one of your other favorite media.

Avoid duplicate gifts:
One of the significant advantages of using the app is that you won't receive duplicate gifts for birthdays, Christmas, confirmations, weddings, etc. Your guests can see what is being reserved by other guests - without you, of course, being able to see it yourself.
You can use the GoWish app, or you can use GoWish through your browser. As a user, you always have your wishlist at hand. Easy and simple.

Super easy to use:
If you come across something you want, you can save it in two ways.

If it's on a website, you can save your wish directly with a single click on the wish button in your share-menu on your iPhone or iPad.
You can also copy the link to your gift wish and then go to the app and press ""create wish automatically,"" paste the link, and the app takes care of the rest :)

We recommend that you use one of the two automatic methods to create your wishes, making it super easy for your friends to find and buy exactly what you want.
All your wishes end up in the same place and are accessible, whether you use the app on your iPhone, iPad, or log in to our website.

Benefits of using the digital universe og GoWish:

Easily create all kinds of wishes from all online stores worldwide
Save wishes online with just one click on the wish button
You can create all the wishlists you need
You can create a wishlist with your partner - e.g., a wedding wishlist
You can create wishlists on behalf of family members or friends
You can share wishlists digitally with your friends and family
Avoid wrong gifts or two of the same gift
Get inspiration from friends and family when exchanging wishlists
You can follow your friends' wishlists
You can find inspiration for your next wishlist from all the coolest brands

GoWish - wishes should be saved, not forgotten.",2023-04-03T07:00:00Z,2025-11-20T17:54:07Z

Hush is the ultimate anonymous chat app designed for those who seek authentic connections, open-minded exploration, and freedom of expression. Whether you're into deep talks, casual flirting, or discreet chats, Hush provides a secure and judgment-free space to be yourself, fully, freely, and without filters.
In a world where dating apps often focus on appearances, Hush puts emotional connection first. Like a private room for your thoughts, Hush allows you to explore your intimate thoughts, interests, or curiosities with people who get it.

How Hush Works
It begins with your anonymous profile : we verify your phone number and confirm you’re old enough to use the service. We don’t store any personal data : this step is only for authentication and to ensure there’s a real human behind the phone.
Share your voice, text, photos, or short videos while staying in control. From blind chats to open-minded friendly conversations, discover an inclusive community ready to connect on your terms.

Talk Freely, Explore Safely
Hush is for everyone: curious minds, adventurous couples, the shy, the bold, the asexual, the straight, the queer. We welcome all walks of life and every way of connecting. Whether you're exploring new conversations, discovering new communities, or just chatting anonymously, this is your space.

Key Features

Discreet & Secure: SafeLock ensures your content stays private. Screenshots are blocked, chats are encrypted, and photos disappear after being viewed.
Text-First Experience: Skip the pressure of in-person meetups. Connect through words, voice notes, and photos. Ideal for those seeking connection without face-to-face interaction.
No Judgment, Just Connection: Enjoy honest, playful, or flirty chats in anonymous chat rooms, with full control over your identity and content.
Inclusive & Welcoming: We support every identity and orientation.
Moderation That Cares: Our AI moderation helps keep Hush respectful, kind, and real. We’re like the purr of apps: smooth, sleek, and designed for consent-first interaction.

Find Your Vibe
Whether you’re into chatting with people near you, trying out social discovery apps like Bumble, Tinder, Pure, Feeld, or browsing a dating app for young adults like Twinby or Aisle, Hush gives you that private, pressure-free place to connect.

We Respect Your Privacy
Your data is protected under our strict privacy policy. We never share personal info. Soon, user verification will add an extra layer of community safety.

Subscription Details
Hush is free to download. Optional subscriptions unlock extra features. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation. Subscriptions auto-renew unless turned off 24 hours before the end of the billing period. Manage in your Apple account settings.
