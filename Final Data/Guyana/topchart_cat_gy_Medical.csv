Watch wonderful ultrasound videos of babies in different weeks of pregnancy. If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.

ScanBaby is divided into three different modes:

-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.

-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.

-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.

Not too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.
- Track your pregnancy journey. Get weekly insights on pregnancy symptoms, learn how to read ultrasound scans, monitor contractions, and keep track of your baby’s movements with a kick counter.

For best results:

- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.
- Use the app in a quiet room
- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)
- Put the phone in Airplane Mode
- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press ""Record"" to create a recording
- Use AirPods

gy,Guyana,Medical,6020,7,426019807,ABG Acid-Base eval,Joshua D. steinberg,https://apps.apple.com/gy/app/abg-acid-base-eval/id426019807?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Medical,"ABG Acid-Base eval walks a clinician through a stepwise approach to analyse ABG's and electrolytes in order to arrive at acid-base disorders and diagnostic ideas about ill patients.  It is based mainly upon a worksheet developed by Dr. Erik Rupard from the medical literature.  This tool not only yields answers, but just as importantly teaches the stepwise thinking process and the necessary concepts along the way.  A clinician or learner will wind up with good information that assists patient care and should wind up a little smarter and more able to do it with less assistance the next time.  It is a great support for those of us clinicians who use these tests only occasionally and don't have it memorized.   The differential diagnoses include the classic mnemonics like MUDPILERS, CHAMPS, CLEVER PD, and HARDUPS, with explanations and examples.

The app addresses such common questions as:

    * What are common causes of metabolic acidosis? respiratory alkalosis?
    * How do I calculate predicted pCO2? corrected bicarbonate?
    * What is the primary acid-base disorder?
    * Are additional acid-base disorders present, and if so, what are they?

This app is written and intended for practicing clinicians like internists, family physicians, ER docs, cardiologists, pulmonologists, intensivists, and hospitalists; for resident physician trainees; for medical students; and of course for other clinician colleagues like NP's and PA's.  As an educator and clinician, I am interested in feedback and I would be grateful for guidance on improving the tool.

Notes of importance:
- many thresholds and cutoffs are arbitrary and debatable, so you will have to use judgment to interpret which disorders are present and to what extent when suggested by the app
- the app facilitates you to evaluate the data.  If you make a mistake, the app will not argue with you.  It will, at the end, offer to compare your work to the disorders that the app finds using the same algorithm
- patients are more than the sums of their numbers and data, and they are often unique individuals.  Use this information as a starting point in the evaluation of your patient and always do your own thinking!",2011-07-10T10:24:25Z,2020-05-20T12:47:11Z

Whether you are a physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or student, ABG Expert is your ideal acid base analysis app. 




Accuracy- 

• ABG Expert has been validated using extensive testing under real-world conditions.

• No need to worry about entering physiologically impossible data by mistake. Data is checked for plausibility and for internal consistency using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

• An accurate analysis depends on an accurate anion gap. ABG Expert has you covered with automatic correction of the anion gap when albumin is provided. 

• Never again wonder about how a result was obtained. Detailed explanations include easy-to-understand equations so you can be sure the calculations are correct. 


Flexibility- 

• Need the arterial blood gas analysis, but not the anion gap or A-a gradient? No problem. ABG Expert can analyze the data for all three results separately or together. 

• Set the normal anion gap range based on the normal range at your institution. Or, use your patient’s own baseline anion gap to maximize your sensitivity to detect disorders. 

• Caring for an 80-year-old patient in Denver? Provide age and barometric pressure, and ABG Expert automatically adjusts interpretation of the A-a gradient.  

• Need more specificity? Adjust the normal delta gap range based on the literature you follow in your practice. 

• ABG Expert works as well in Bangkok as it does in Boston with full support for SI and non-SI units. 


Power- 

• Color-coded results allow for rapid analysis in critical situations. One additional click gives you a detailed differential diagnosis and additional recommendations. 

• Concerned about a new problem in your patient with advanced COPD? ABG Expert can adjust its calculations for chronic respiratory conditions so you can detect additional disorders that are missed by other apps. 

• Detailed explanations of disorders integrate ABG, anion gap, and A-a gradient results providing individualized answers like no textbook can. 

• Refine your differential diagnosis even further with the included osmolal gap and urine anion gap calculators.

• ABG Expert combines beauty and brains with optimization for iOS devices running iOS 13 and later.
