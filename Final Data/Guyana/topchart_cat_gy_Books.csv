Wondering what kind of stories we might bring you? Let's take a sneak peek at a couple.

-- I gulped and straightened up, blushing and feeling hot under her intense gaze. June Watson. The one girl I’ve always had a crush on. Heck, there was no counting the number of dreams I’ve had about her, and all the things I’ve fantasized about us doing.

-- When Amber's mother announced that she would remarry, Amber knew her feelings for James, her future stepfather, were inappropriate. She tried to push her fantasies to older students at the college, but none of them ever seemed to satisfy her. Maybe it was the lack of a father figure in her life, but she was drawn to James almost immediately.

-- The game went on, fired up with wild dares and barely a sprinkle of truths. So far, no one’s tried to escape their dares, Jamie noticed as he watched Sasha and Ava kneel and face each other. Sasha had been dared to make out with someone - she’d picked randomly from pieces of paper with all their names on them.

La Biblia, que es, los sacros libros del Viejo y Nuevo Testamento. Trasladada en español. La Palabra del Dios nuestro permanece para siempre. 1569, también conocida como la Biblia del Oso, es la primera traducción completa de la Biblia al español, publicada el 28 de septiembre de 1569. Su traductor fue Casiodoro de Reina. La Biblia del Oso es usualmente referida como Reina-Valera (RV) por haber hecho Cipriano de Valera la primera revisión de ella en 1602.
La Reina-Valera tuvo amplia difusión durante la Reforma Protestante del siglo XVI. Hoy en día, la Reina-Valera (con varias revisiones a través de los años) es una de las biblias en español más usadas por gran parte de las iglesias cristianas derivadas de la Reforma (incluyendo las iglesias evangélicas), así como por otros grupos de fe cristiana, como la Iglesia Adventista del Séptimo Día, La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días, los Gedeones Internacionales y otros cristianos no denominacionales.
Traducción de Reina
Casiodoro de Reina, monje jerónimo español del Monasterio de San Isidoro del Campo, tras partir al exilio para escapar de las persecuciones de la Inquisición, trabajó durante doce años en la traducción de la Biblia. La Biblia del Oso fue publicada en Basilea, Suiza. Es llamada Biblia del Oso por la ilustración en su portada de un oso que intenta alcanzar un panal de miel colgado de un árbol. Se colocó esa ilustración, logotipo del impresor bávaro Mattias Apiarius, en la portada para evitar el uso de íconos religiosos, porque en aquel tiempo estaba prohibida cualquier traducción de la Biblia a lenguas vernáculas.
La traducción del Antiguo Testamento, como lo declara expresamente Casiodoro de Reina en su “Amonestación del intérprete de los sacros libros al lector”, se basó en el texto masorético hebreo (edición de Bomberg, 1525). Como consideraba que la Vulgata latina ya había cumplido su papel y contenía errores y cambios, prefirió usar como fuente secundaria la traducción al latín de Sanctes Pagnino (Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio, 1528), porque “al voto de todos los doctos en la lengua hebraica es tenida por la más pura que hasta ahora hay”, corrigiendo la versión masorética cada vez que se aparta de las citas del Antiguo en el Nuevo Testamento. Tuvo siempre a mano para resolver las dudas la Biblia de Ferrara (Abraham Usque y Yom-Tob Athias, 1553), traducción del hebreo al judeoespañol usada por los judíos sefardíes, que Reina consideraba “obra de la mayor estima”, “por dar la natural y primera significación de los vocablos hebreos y las diferencias de los tiempos de los verbos”.
Para la traducción del Nuevo Testamento, Reina se basó en el Textus Receptus (Erasmo 1516, Stephanus, 1550), en la Políglota Complutense y en los mejores manuscritos griegos que en ese tiempo se conocían. Al parecer, tenía a la vista las versiones del Nuevo Testamento de Juan Pérez de Pineda de 1556, Francisco de Enzinas de 1543 y traducciones de Juan de Valdés.",2016-07-08T19:01:11Z,2025-06-09T06:20:36Z
gy,Guyana,Books,6018,19,1302874308,Shrimad Bhagavad Gita English,Mohit Agarwal,https://apps.apple.com/gy/app/shrimad-bhagavad-gita-english/id1302874308?uo=4,0.0,4.85714,7,Book,"Bhagavad Gita is knowledge of five basic truths and the relationship of each truth to the other: These five truths are Krishna, or God, the individual soul, the material world, action in this world, and time. The Gita lucidly explains the nature of consciousness, the self, and the universe. It is the essence of India's spiritual wisdom.

Bhagavad Gita, is a part of the 5th Veda (written by Vedavyasa - ancient Indian saint) and Indian Epic - Mahabharata. It was narrated for the first time in the battle of Kurukshetra, by Lord Krishna to Arjun.

The Bhagavad Gita also referred to as Gita, is a 700–verse Dharmic scripture that is part of the ancient Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. This scripture contains a conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Krishna on a variety of philosophical issues.

Faced with a fratricidal war, a despondent Arjuna turns to his charioteer Krishna for counsel on the battlefield. Krishna, through the course of the Bhagavad Gita, imparts to Arjuna wisdom, the path to devotion, and the doctrine of selfless action. The Bhagavad Gita upholds the essence and the philosophical tradition of the Upanishads. However, unlike the rigorous monism of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita also integrates dualism and theism.

Numerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials, beginning with Adi Sankara's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in the eighth century CE. Commentators see the setting of the Bhagavad Gita in a battlefield as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life. The Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his ""spiritual dictionary"".
