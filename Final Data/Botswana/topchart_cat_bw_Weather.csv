""Best weather app!
I absolutely love this weather app! It alerts me when it’s going to rain, has an easy to view radar map on the home screen and is extremely easy to navigate through. I would choose this app over Accuweather, which I have used for years!"" - Bchan80.

""Super accurate weather app
This is the coolest weather app. The data is the lost accurate and precise by far. Better weather prediction and user interface than Dark Sky. If you really want to get accurate weather, check out Climacell."" - Markymark7419

Love this app! It’s a game changer.  So much more accurate down to the minute, for example I’m an avid biker and motorcycle rider, knowing when and where the rain will come with this level of precision is awesome."" - RBrider65

CHANGE THE TIME
In the settings, you can switch between ‘Your time’ and ‘Local time.’ To switch between them, click the ‘Your time’ and ‘Local time’ options on the clock's hour section.

ADD LOCATION ON APPLE WATCH
It’s handy to know that the first location added to your list is set as the location on your Apple Watch. To edit or change this, you can reorder the cities in your location overview on your iPhone.

CHANGE MY BACKGROUND VIDEO
Unfortunately, you can’t manually select a video to play as a background. The app selects a random video from a pool of weather videos that match the weather for the report you’re currently viewing.
You can expand this pool of videos by unlocking videos in the menu screen, which is done by watching a short ad per video.

What people are saying:

""It's a million impressive little things. It's the blurring of the background; it's the subtle parallax scroll when flipping between cities; it's the way the windmills spin faster or slower based on the actual current windspeed."" - Greg Kumparak, TechCrunch
