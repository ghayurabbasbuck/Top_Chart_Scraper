Ищите в Яндексе так, как вам удобно: текстом, голосом, или по картинке. На сложные вопросы Алиса даст подробные ответы с картинками и видео. А если вы размышляете о покупке — покажет товары, которые рекомендуют в обзорах и посоветует, на какие параметры обратить внимание при выборе. Также приложение подскажет, кто звонит с незнакомого номера, поможет выбрать выгодный вклад, разобраться в сложных вопросах и решить другие повседневные задачи.

Алиса — ещё и нейросеть для самых разных задач. Заглядывайте в чат и спросите Алису — она ответит. Дайте задачу — порассуждает, рассмотрит её со всех сторон и объяснит решение. Попросите — нарисует картинку или сгенерирует текст. Киньте в чат файл — изучит его за вас и ответит на вопросы по содержанию. Всё это бесплатно, нужно только войти в аккаунт на Яндексе.

Умная камера. Наведите на уравнение или математическую задачу — и камера объяснит, как их решать. А ещё она распознаёт предметы, рассказывает о них и советует, где купить; переводит надписи, открывает QR-коды и даже заменяет собой сканер.

Бесплатный автоматический определитель номера. Включите АОН в меню настроек или попросите: «Алиса, включи определитель номера». Он покажет, кто звонит, даже если номера нет в контактах. База данных из более чем 5 миллионов организаций и отзывы пользователей сэкономят время и защитят от нежелательных разговоров.

Поисковые вертикали: Квартиры, Товары и Финансы. Вертикаль — это специализированный поиск, который помогает найти и сравнить разные предложения по конкретной теме и выбрать самое выгодное или подходящее. С удобными фильтрами можно подобрать выгодный вклад, нужный товар и даже квартиру. Для этого не придётся изучать разные сайты — Поиск покажет предложения из разных источников.

Погода с точностью до района. Подробный почасовой прогноз на текущий день с динамической картой осадков, ветров, температуры и давления. И ежедневный — на неделю вперёд с детальной информацией о скорости ветра, атмосферном давлении и уровне влажности. А ещё — специальные режимы с полезной погодной информацией для рыбаков, садоводов и не только.
