Thus, it is the ideal sidekick for airline CEOs, operations control managers and all aviation professionals, who are keen to have their business KPIs at hand: ANYTIME. ANYWHERE.

91% of our customers confirm that with aWall they discover new potentials and rule every situation in daily operations.
To achieve this, aWall comes with KPI presets as for example the global operations package, misconnex KPIs or aviation weather information. You decide which KPIs are to be used in which context. At a glance you want to assimilate the performance of your flights? Or the delay minutes your first-class passengers had to experience today? You name it. You get it.

The visualization has a modern design that gets to the heart of information. Use a column chart to see if the punctuality of your flights changes throughout the day. Or watch every single flight move across the world map — tackling any kind of unpunctuality. With aWall you always have a clear picture of the current situation.


BE THE FIRST TO KNOW, WHAT IS GOING ON.
Real time KPIs are delivered to your device, due to aWall’s own business intelligence platform, working in the background. Air traffic control measures or weather conditions impede flight operations? You’re the first to know. The de-icing at your hub airport isn't fast enough? You’re the first to know. Flights arrive more than three hours late? You’re the first to know. 

And here's the extra something: You get all the information with minimal IT effort. All your team has to do is connect your data sources.


FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT.
Nowadays, there is no spare time for overloaded diagrams. This is why aWall uses a smart color system, highlighting the important information. Traffic light colors based on your individual target values enable you to instantly capture the status of your airline operations and identify potential weak spots. Then take the appropriate actions. 

Imagine the end of a day, when your operational KPIs are all green.


MAKE THINGS MOVE FAST.
Swipe through your KPI setup to access information right away. Zoom in or out of a map with a flick of the wrist. With just one tap on a graphical element, an airplane on the world map for example, you receive detailed information. 

It’s that kind of interaction that increases not only your information insight but also your productivity.


MANY DEVICES. ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH. 
Whether it’s the aWall mobile app or the aWall display hanging in your office: All devices connect to the same scalable and cloud based business intelligence system, which assures you being up-to-date with your airline information wherever you are. 

This is what we call aCloud.


LOGIN REQUIRED.
In order to use the aWall app, your aCloud user account is required. Of course, the authentication and authorization system is just one of various built-in security measures. With state-of-the-art techniques as in secure data transfer, database encryption and security monitoring, the aCloud platform provides a sound and reliable environment for your data.",2020-01-28T08:00:00Z,2021-03-30T23:55:55Z

“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“
