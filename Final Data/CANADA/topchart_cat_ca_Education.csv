Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.

Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.

Students can keep track of what's due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks from within Classroom.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has handed in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.

There are many benefits of using Classroom:

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time
The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.

Improves organisation
Students can see all of their assignments on an Assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.

Enhances communication
Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.

Secure
Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, and never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.

Permissions notice:
Camera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.
Microphone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.

Stop Scrolling Social Media -> Download Deepstash -> Use it for 5 min/day -> Become the smartest in the room.

Join 3 Million+ smart people to discover new ideas, learn new things, improve yourself and inspire others.

Knowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.

Ideas are created by users just like you. Whenever you read a book, article or listen to a podcast and find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, you can add an idea about it in Deepstash. You see the source of the idea right in your feed.

What to do with ideas? They are fundamental to your wellbeing, success in life or your career. Ideas can make you:
- Smarter (you'll know more stuff, doh!)
- More Creative (you can connect more dots)
- Happier (better habits, less anxiety)

Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.

PERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS

Choose a few topics of interest and directions (like increasing productivity, building better habits or earning more money) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.

The more you read and save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.

BUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

You can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.

Search and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes.

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Add your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.

Share your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this.
