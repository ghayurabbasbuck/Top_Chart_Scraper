With fresh deals added daily, you’ll find go-to staples and new foods to discover. From chicken wings to crab cakes, kiwis to strawberries*, Flashfood helps you switch up your meals. And if you don’t see your find today — check back tomorrow. We might surprise you.

THE FRESHEST DEALS IN TOWN
We partner with major grocery stores like Meijer, GIANT and Stop & Shop to score you savings close to home. Same-day pick up, no long lines — just unbeatable deals. The real question is: how will you fit it all in the fridge?

WHO SHOULD USE FLASHFOOD?
People who eat food. That’s who. And people who love a great deal. And a great meal. 

HOW DOES IT WORK? WE’RE GLAD YOU ASKED
1. Download Flashfood and create an account
2. Browse grocery deals at nearby stores
3. Add items to your cart and buy in the app
4. Pick up your haul from the Flashfood Zone at your local partner store

WARNING: Upon finding your first amazing flash deal, spontaneous dancing for joy may occur.

WHAT’S THE CATCH? 
There’s no catch! Grocers are working hard to end food waste. By selling meat, produce, and prepared foods at big discounts on Flashfood, our partners ensure that surplus items – whether seasonal, overstocked, or nearing expiration — end up on dinner tables, not in the landfill.

2.	Upload unlimited private recipes to your private recipe collection.

You can start a 7-day free trial to access these premium features. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged the price indicated on the payment screen for your chosen subscription period. The ReciMe Premium subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each month or year) until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal will be disabled.
