Save time and money by comparing flight prices across multiple airlines, online travel agencies and travel booking platforms to get the best price. There are no booking fees or hidden charges—just the lowest prices on domestic and international flights.

Skyscanner is more than just flights. Find cheap hotels, luxury resorts, airport hotels, and vacation rentals with our hotel search, ensuring you have the perfect place to stay wherever you go. Need transportation? Compare and book affordable rental cars from top providers.

Here’s how to use our app:

Find inspiration
Can’t decide where to go? Start by exploring everywhere first. Tap “Everywhere” in our search bar to find low-cost flights literally anywhere around the world and get ideas for your next vacation.

Filter your search
Know what you’re looking for? Use our smart filters to search by flight duration, airline, number of stops, travel class, departure and arrival times. Looking for last-minute travel deals? Use filters to find flexible options and spontaneous getaways at the lowest prices.

The best time to fly
You’ve chosen where it will be, now we’ll help you find the best dates to book your travel. Our calendar view breaks down the cheapest dates in a chosen month so you can find the right flight deal. Not ready to book yet? Set up a Price Alert and we’ll let you know when the flight price changes so you’re always booking at the right time.

The right hotel at the right price
Thought we were just about discount flights? Nope, we’ve got your stay covered too. Compare and book budget hotels, luxury resorts, vacation rentals, motels and hostels all over the world. Or, easily find hotel rooms near your current location and grab a last-minute hotel deal for your next vacation.

Car rentals
Choose where and when to pick up your rental car, and we’ll show you affordable options from top car rental agencies. You can filter your search by vehicle type, fuel type and features. And our Fair Fuel Policy flag will make sure you’re not paying too much on fuel – we’ve got your back. Find the best rental car deals from top car rental providers like Hertz, Budget, Avis and Enterprise. 

Book with who you trust
Compare all your top travel and flight providers, including online travel agencies (OTA), in one place – Air Canada, WestJet, Air Transat, Flair Airlines, Lufthansa, FlightNetwork, FlightHub, Expedia, Trip.com, Booking.com and more. Plus, get recent reviews on our travel partners from our community of travelers.

No added fees ever
Did we mention we don’t charge any booking fees? Never. None at all. Book directly with airlines, hotels, and travel agency services with total transparency.

Save your flights
Want to look but not ready to book a flight? No problem. We have a “saved” feature where you can “heart” flights or hotels you like. Then it’ll show up on your trips, so you can pick up where you left off and book your travel.

At the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.
