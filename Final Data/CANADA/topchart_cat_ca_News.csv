“This Spring, we decided to sell lots of old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor. In no time, our neighbours stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighbourhood.” - App review


OUR MISSION

To make every neighbourhood feel like home.
Our mission is to make every neighbourhood feel like home. We do this by connecting neighbours to the local gems around them – people, places, and information. These local connections improve our lives by fostering a sense of community and belonging no matter where we live. 

YOUR PRIVACY

Nextdoor is a trusted environment where all neighbours are verified, making it safe to share online the kinds of things you'd be okay sharing with your neighbours in person.

Here's how:

• Every neighbour verifies their address when they join Nextdoor
• All members go by their real names, just like in person

Continued use of Location Services running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Nextdoor doesn't run Location Services in the background unless you give us permission by turning on optional features that require it.
