Example Calculation:
Suppose you borrow 100,000 for 91 days at the maximum APR of 22%.
The daily interest rate is approximately 0.06027%.

Total repayment amount:
100000 (principal) + 548 (interest) = 100,548
No service fee is charged, and the amount you receive is the full 100,000. You repay 100,548 at the end of the loan term.
