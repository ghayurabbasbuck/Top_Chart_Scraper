A MÁV+ alkalmazás hónapról-hónapra éri majd el a teljes funkcionalitást, várhatóan 2026-ban. A régi alkalmazás addig változatlanul használható marad, de újabb funkciók ott már nem várhatók.
Jelenleg elérhető díjtermékek és főbb funkciók a MÁV+ alkalmazásban:
- Országbérlet, vármegyebérlet, Magyarország24 és Vármegye24 díjtermékek vásárlása egyszerűbben és gyorsabban megvásárolható, megszűnt a bérletigazolvány. A viszonylati jegyek érkezése még nyár előtt várható!
- Vonatjegy, buszjegy vásárlás a MÁV-csoport helyközi járataira
- Késési biztosításhoz kapcsolódó funkciók
- Helyjegyvásárlás letisztult, átlátható módon. Egyszerűbbé tettük a távolsági buszok esetén is a helyjegyek vásárlásának menetét.
- Útvonaltervezés már nem csak busszal vagy vonattal, hanem háztól-házig bármilyen helyközi vagy helyi járattal lehetséges. A helyi járatokra való jegyvásárlás azonban még nem érhető el.
- Gyorsabb bejelentkezés és fizetési megoldások, így már qvik és mobiltárcás fizetésre is van lehetőség van a SIMPLE rendszerén keresztül.

‣ Miért érdemes letölteni?
   ‣ KGFB kedvezmény – Drivello-kedvezménnyel jelentős megtakarítást érhetsz el.
   ‣ Ingyenes autó-asszisztencia – Az appból hívható „Drivello Angyal” vészhelyzetben segít egy éven át.

3. Élvezd az előnyöket – kedvezőbb KGFB, asszisztencia, kihívások, shop.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Az app a Volán társaságok hivatalos keresője is. A Volán, a MÁV, és a Bahart több mint 20000 megállóhelye, és az ország összes települése közötti keresést biztosítja.

A szoftver megállók és települések közti eljutások keresésére képes. A beviteli mezőben teljes és részleges egyezéskor is ad találatot, például ""bp st"" megadásával kihozható ""Budapest, Stadion autóbusz-pályaudvar"". A szoftver egy adott megállóhelyre indulási, illetve érkezési jegyzéket is képes adni. Ehhez elég csak az egyik beviteli mezőt kitölteni és úgy végezni egy keresést.

A szoftver a telefon beépített GPS-ével az indulási megállóhelyet is meghatározhatja. Megállóhely kereséskor a beírómezőben megjelenő pozíció jelölőt megérintve, az alkalmazás 1500m távolságon belüli legközelebbi megállóhelyet megkeresi. A beállításokban megadott időintervallumra előre, a megadott időponttól jeleníti meg. 

A szoftver találati listája, a webes változattal összhangban, a ""BEÁLLÍTÁSOK"" segítségével  finomhangolható. Lehetőség van a találatok rendezésére indulási és érkezési idő, menetidő, jegyár (jelenleg csak Volán kereséskor), illetve átszállás szerint. Megadható az átszállási idők időtartama, illetve a maximális gyaloglás hossza is.

A legutolsó 20 lekérés automatikusan elmentésre kerül és az ""ELŐZMÉNYEK"" menüpontból érhető el. A legutóbbi lekérések internet nélkül is megtekinthetőek az előzményekben, illetve ha van kapcsolat, frissíthetők is. Az előzmények törölhetőek is a listából. A bármely napra való kereshetőség biztosítja, hogy a hét közbeni, és a hétvégi menetrendeket egy táblázatba mentsük le.

A térkép a találati listából, és az indulási jegyzékből egy járat kiválasztása után, a részletes információkban a térkép ikon megérintésével előhívható. A térkép előhívásakor a kiválasztott járat induló, és érkező megállóhelye, valamint útvonala is látszik. A megállóhelynevet a jelölő pontot megérintve hívhatjuk elő. Amennyiben be van kapcsolva a tartózkodási hely, megjelenik a térképen a telefon GPS pozíciója is.

Aki utazik vonattal vagy busszal, azzal előfordul, hogy nem tud számítógép közelben lenni, hogy ellenőrizze a menetrendet. Ez az alkalmazás nekik készült, hogy gyorsan, egyszerűen, adatforgalom-takarékos módon kapjanak utazási információkat.
