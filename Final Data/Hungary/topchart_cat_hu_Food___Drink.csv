hu,Hungary,Food & Drink,6023,20,6749859973,Egg Row Keeper,Mortu Dumitru,https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/egg-row-keeper/id6749859973?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Food & Drink,"EggRow Keeper is a charming fridge inventory app with a unique twist — everything is designed around the metaphor of eggs in a refrigerator. The interface looks like a cozy fridge, and each product is visualized as an item in a nest, with eggs taking center stage. It helps users track food items, monitor expiration dates, estimate the total value of their fridge, and manage a shopping list — all wrapped in a light-hearted, visually engaging experience.

The main screen displays your virtual fridge with organized shelves. You can add products manually, specifying name, category, quantity, purchase date, and expiration. Categories include dairy, vegetables, meat, eggs, and others — each placed on its own ""shelf."" Eggs are treated as a special product type, displayed in a dedicated egg tray. When an item expires, it’s marked with a distinct “rotten egg” icon for quick recognition. You can also view a filtered list of soon-to-expire or missing items.

EggRow Keeper includes a simple analysis tool. When adding items, you can enter their price (per unit, kilogram, liter, etc.). The app then calculates the total ""value"" of your fridge contents. A category breakdown shows where most of your spending goes (e.g., ""Dairy — 38%""). It also keeps track of patterns — how often you buy eggs, which items run out the fastest, and more.

The integrated shopping list helps with restocking. Items that are out of stock are suggested for the list automatically, but you can add or remove anything manually. Once an item is marked “purchased,” it can be moved directly into your fridge. You can also sort the list by category, making trips to the store more efficient.

A unique feature of the app is the “Egg of the Day” — a daily card offering a fun fact, quote, or practical food storage tip. The cards come in various humorous moods like “The Philosopher Egg” or “The Proud Egg.” You can save these cards to your gallery or share them with friends on social media.

Additional settings include expiration reminders, currency and unit preferences, data reset, and access to the privacy policy and developer info. EggRow Keeper offers a practical yet playful approach to home food organization — especially for egg lovers.",2025-08-12T07:00:00Z,2025-08-27T19:30:13Z
