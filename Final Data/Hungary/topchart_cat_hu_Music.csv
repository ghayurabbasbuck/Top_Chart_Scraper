Hallgatás közben láthatod, hogy milyen dal szól az aktuálisan hallgatott online rádióban, láthatod, hogy az adott dalhoz milyen borítókép tartozik, visszakeresheted, hogy korábban milyen dalok voltak hallhatók 1 hónapra visszamenőleg. Ezen felül egyes rádiókhoz műsorújság is tartozik, amik segítségével megnézheted egy hétre előre, hogy milyen műsorok lesznek. 

Néhány rádió támogatja azt, hogy ne csak hallgassák a műsort, hanem akár webkamerán keresztül nézhessék is. Keresd a funkciót az adott rádió aloldalán a fejlécben.

Lehetőséged van az általad hallgatott online rádiókat a kedvencek közé rakni, hogy később könnyebben megtaláld őket.
