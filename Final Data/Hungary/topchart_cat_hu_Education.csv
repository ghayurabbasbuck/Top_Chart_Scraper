Enhances communication

Secure
Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, and never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.

Our word-building exercises activate your visual memory and improve your language skills. Get one step ahead of everyone who studies English.
 
*It gets you speaking right away*
 
The first 500 most popular words and phrases will serve as a powerful boost for your English. You will learn to describe your life, socialize and speak in the workplace more confidently.

*Read in English and learn words naturally*

With 10-Minute English, you also have the opportunity to read popular books in English. The novels have been specially selected and adapted for your learning. Instantly translate words and sentences and learn them in context — this is a natural and engaging way to enrich your vocabulary.
 
*You learn fast*
 
In 3 months, you will cover a language program designed for a one-year college course.

Az új Universum.hu app gyorsabb, átláthatóbb és sokkal több élményt nyújt. Úgy alakítottuk ki, hogy pont azt tudja, amire egy EFOTT-fesztiválozónak szüksége van. Legyél kezdő vagy rutinos látogató, ez az app új szintre emeli az EFOTT-élményt és még az egyetemi hétköznapokat is feldobja!

**Jegyek? Pipa.
- Bérlet, napijegy, kemping és fesztiválbusz? Mindent egy helyen érhetsz el, 
és nincs több elfelejtett, elhagyott QR-kód sem! Csak jelentkezz be, és máris eléred minden jegyedet.

**Tervezd meg a saját EFOTT-élményed!
- Jelöld kedvenc koncertjeid, lásd egy felületen a számodra érdekes programokat sőt, ha szeretnéd,
kérj értesítést a koncertek kezdete előtt akár teljesen offline is, a naptárfelületen keresztül. Az elfogyott net nem lehet többé probléma!
- Ne eltévedj! Fedezd inkább fel a teljes fesztivált!
- Találd meg a színpadokat, programhelyszíneket, étel és italzónákat vagy az elsősegély- és vízvételi pontokat az interaktív fesztiváltérképen
könnyebb tájékozódással, gyors infókkal, kevesebb keresgéléssel.

**Játssz, gyűjts pontokat és nyerj! Megérkezett a Fesztiválszak Challenge 2.0!
- Zsebelj be pontokat izgalmas kihívásokon keresztül éjjel és nappal egyaránt.
- Vásárolj a szerzett pontokból egyedi kiegészítőket fesztiválszakos karakteredhez.
- Nyerj 1000 pont felett garantáltan limitált Challenge pólót, sőt akár 2026-os EFOTT bérletet, extra nyereményeket!
