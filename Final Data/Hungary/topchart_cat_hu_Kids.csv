A MÁV+ alkalmazás hónapról-hónapra éri majd el a teljes funkcionalitást, várhatóan 2026-ban. A régi alkalmazás addig változatlanul használható marad, de újabb funkciók ott már nem várhatók.
Jelenleg elérhető díjtermékek és főbb funkciók a MÁV+ alkalmazásban:
- Országbérlet, vármegyebérlet, Magyarország24 és Vármegye24 díjtermékek vásárlása egyszerűbben és gyorsabban megvásárolható, megszűnt a bérletigazolvány. A viszonylati jegyek érkezése még nyár előtt várható!
- Vonatjegy, buszjegy vásárlás a MÁV-csoport helyközi járataira
- Késési biztosításhoz kapcsolódó funkciók
- Helyjegyvásárlás letisztult, átlátható módon. Egyszerűbbé tettük a távolsági buszok esetén is a helyjegyek vásárlásának menetét.
- Útvonaltervezés már nem csak busszal vagy vonattal, hanem háztól-házig bármilyen helyközi vagy helyi járattal lehetséges. A helyi járatokra való jegyvásárlás azonban még nem érhető el.
- Gyorsabb bejelentkezés és fizetési megoldások, így már qvik és mobiltárcás fizetésre is van lehetőség van a SIMPLE rendszerén keresztül.

A felhasználóbarát fejlesztésének köszönhetően könnyen használható bármelyik korosztály számára. A videókoncentrált kialakításnak köszönhetően a felhasználók akár egy kattintással is megtalálhatják a megnézni kívánt tartalmat, az extra funkciók pedig tovább fokozzák a fogyasztói élményt.
A főcsatorna mellett a kábelportfolió műsorainak jelentős része is elérhető a TV2 Play segítségével. A felület ingyenesen, regisztráció után elérhető, személyre szabható profilt hozhat létre a felhasználó. A TV2 Play felhasználói ismét megnézhetik a Dancing with the Stars lenyűgöző táncait, a Megasztár összes évadának legemlékezetesebb produkcióit és győztes pillanatait, a Nagy Duett felejthetetlen előadásait, a Sztárban Sztár fergeteges átalakulásait, valamint a Nicsak, ki vagyok? döbbenetes leleplezéseit is. Az Exatlon Hungary gigászi küzdelmei, drámai pillanatai és legnagyobb győzelmei mind megtalálhatóak a TV2Play felületén – ráadásul a 3. évadban ezek a tartalmak már az egész világon elérhetőek. Ha valaki ismét átélné a Dancing with the Stars látványos produkcióit, akkor azonnal megteheti a streaming felületen.
A sorozatok szerelmeseinek is tartogat meglepetéseket a platform – a Jóban Rosszban összes epizódja megtekinthető már egészen a kezdetektől, ahogy a TV2 és az Izaura TV legnépszerűbb hazai gyártású, vagy éppen török és dél-amerikai sorozatainak visszanézhető epizódjai, továbbá a Mokka emlékezetes, vicces, megható, vagy épp botrányos beszélgetései is mind megtalálhatóak a felületen.
Az aktualitások mellett számos régi kedvenc is feltűnik a TV2 Play-en, így bármikor visszanézhetjük a Hal a tortán, az Aktív, az Ázsia Expressz vagy épp a Bezár a Bazár legérdekesebb epizódjait.
Az applikációban lehetőség van műsorra, tartalomra, csatornára vagy éppen kedvelt színészre vagy színésznőre szűrni, így mindenki megtalálhatja a számára legideálisabb tartalmat. Az alkalmazás figyeli a regisztrált személy, valamint a többi felhasználó aktivitását, és ennek alapján további, számára érdekes tartalmakat javasol a fogyasztónak, amely a korábban megnézett videók alapján érdekelheti a felhasználót. Továbbá a személyes profilnak köszönhetően saját „kedvenc” lista létrehozására is lehetőség van, amely még inkább segíti a pontos tartalomajánlásokat.",2021-08-14T07:00:00Z,2025-10-03T06:34:37Z
