An optional “mood report” function allows students to indicate their daily and current mood. This function features a “gift box”, which can be opened in exchange for providing this information. Hidden inside may be some good music, a witty quotation, or an entertaining video. After providing a certain number of mood reports, the student also receives unique, university gift items. 
In addition to its major academic functions, the application may also provide other types of information in support of everyday student life. Among others these include, university news and events, data and information related to persons or venues closely linked to campus life, opportunities related to the cultural and sports life of the university and the city of Debrecen.

It’s a jaw-dropping, shareable moment of connection when you see your own eyes, your smile, looking back at you from another time. This is the family photograph that was never taken.

But the portrait is just the beginning. It’s your entry point into a complete Ancestral Report, a deep dive into the elements that define your heritage.

First, discover your true origins with a detailed, percentage-based breakdown of your nationality. Go beyond continents to see the specific blend of cultures that make up your unique identity, revealing connections you never knew existed. Then, we reveal their story. Learn about the specific city your ancestors likely called home, the authentic craft they dedicated their lives to, and even the historical diet that fueled their world.

Your origin story doesn't just end in the past—it echoes in your present. The resilience of a frontiersman, the precision of an artisan, the creativity of a storyteller; these are more than historical facts, they are potential traits within you. We connect your heritage to your life today, offering unique insights for modern careers and lifestyles that may align with these ancestral strengths. It’s a powerful new way to understand your own passions and potential.

Join a growing community of people discovering themselves in a completely new way. The stories and portraits generated by EDNA are sparking conversations, connecting families, and helping people see their own identity in a richer, deeper light. It's a unique experience everyone is talking about.

This robust framework allows us to create a narrative that feels both magical and deeply plausible. We are committed to your privacy; your photo and personal data are always secure and are never shared.
