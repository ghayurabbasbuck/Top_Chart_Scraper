WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT US?

“You actually learn fun math facts and fill gaps when you compulsively reach for your phone. Useful app!” — KellyR.

“Hands-on app to improve your financial literacy, the lessons are practical and fun!” — AlvesT.

“This app has taught me how to understand abstract art. It’s truly eye-opening and easy to digest.” — Josel.P

“Nibble is top-notch to learn on the go! I like the probability lesson, it’s really practical and easy to follow.” — Isikatony

""The lessons are quick, fun (the Egyptian section with the tweets between the gods made me and my 12-year-old chuckle), clever - and genuinely interesting. My kid and I will go through lessons together - it’s interesting enough to keep his attention, and I’m learning new things too. Not too advanced for him, or remedial for me. I’ve enjoyed all the lessons - logic (the infinite hotel theory was great), art, math, and history. It is indeed much more enjoyable than doom scrolling. I encourage you to take a chance, I’m hooked. Please keep the new lessons coming!"" — BustedKate

HOW DOES IT WORK?

After you decide to learn with Nibble and download the app, you can choose a subscription plan most suitable for your goals.

The Nibble subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each month, 3 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the selected option) until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal will be disabled. However, you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period.

If you start a free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial.

Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.
