Turn Text into Speech and Open Your Ears to the Written Word

Listen AI isn't just a text-to-speech tool, it's your effortless companion for a world of information, narrated at your pace. Here's how Listen AI elevates your experience:

Unmatched Vocal Majesty: Immerse yourself in a variety of crystal-clear, expressive voices that blur the line between human and machine. Choose from a range of accents and personalities to find the perfect narrator for any content, be it a casual blog post or a formal report.

Customization at Your Fingertips: Tailor your listening experience to your preferences. Adjust the speaking rate to match your comprehension speed, or fine-tune the volume for optimal comfort.

Effortless Integration: Forget copy-pasting. Listen AI seamlessly converts text from documents and web pages into spoken content. Highlight a passage on a website, a section in a PDF, or an entire document, and Listen AI will bring it to life with its captivating narration.

Multitasking Masterclass: Free up your eyes and ears for other activities. Listen to articles, web pages, and PDFs while you exercise, commute, cook, or complete chores. Listen AI lets you learn and stay informed while you conquer your to-do list.

Accessibility Champion: Listen AI is a game-changer for those with visual impairments or learning disabilities. Reading lengthy documents or educational materials can be a challenge. Listen AI transforms text into an engaging audio experience, making learning and information access more accessible than ever before.

Listen AI: It's not just reading, it's experiencing.

The machine has its own strange rules that must be followed carefully. Once the game begins, there is no way to pause or leave until all the goals are completed. If the player tries to escape, they will find that it’s impossible. 
As the tension builds, the player searches for the man who sold the ticket, but the counter is deserted. Suddenly, a phone rings — a stranger’s voice on the other end tells the player to complete the goals and find the key to escape. To survive, the player must buy another ticket, restart the slot machine, and collect all the required coins. Every spin could bring them closer to freedom or trap them forever. It’s up to the player to decide if they can outsmart the horrifying play area — or become part of it.",2025-11-20T08:00:00Z,2025-11-20T08:00:00Z
