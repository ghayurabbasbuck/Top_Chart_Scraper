When you read aloud, the app responds to your voice with delightful sounds and music. For a child, this is a wondrous audio journey, free from any screen time.

REASONS WHY YOU’LL LOVE READMIO
— We help build a positive attitude towards reading
— We create stories with the intention of supporting the mental and emotional development of children
— Our stories are short and easy to integrate with other activities
— Reading with sounds works offline and with your privacy in mind
— We add new stories every week
— It’s fun not only for your children but for you as well

LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS
— Stories and fairy tales also include audiobooks. This is handy when you can’t read or while driving.
— Your presence while listening to audiobooks has a positive effect. If you also maintain physical contact (holding hands, stroking the head), it’s even better.

CREATE YOUR OWN AUDIOBOOKS
— Each fairy tale or story you read aloud can be recorded and automatically transformed into your very own audiobook! With just one click.
— You can listen to the audiobooks while travelling in the car or children can listen to your voice when you are away.
— Audiobooks you create can be shared with your family or friends.

COLOURING AND MORE
— Stories include colouring pages you can print and let your children color them. It’s a great activity children can do while you read to them or the next day.
— You can also print any story and read it without the phone.

BY PARENTS FOR PARENTS
Readmio is an app full of fairy tales that we have enriched with sounds. Just download the app, save a story to the library and start reading! While you read out loud, the app follows along and adds sounds at exactly the right moment. You don’t have to worry about anything, just read at a regular speed and our application will listen to you and enhance your experience. That’s it. For best results, don’t read too fast and avoid noisy environments (e.g. in the car).

A SMALL THEATRE AT HOME
Feel free to put even more into the storytelling, our sounds and music will help you. For example, try making different voices or facial expressions and make a small home theater for your children. Your acting performance is very important for the whole experience. Some parents even prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker to make the sounds and music create a colorful atmosphere throughout the whole room.

WHY THERE AREN’T ANY ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STORIES?
The fairy tales have beautiful cover illustrations that will help you and your children choose what you are going to read. However, the children's contact with the mobile phone should end there. In the stories themselves, we did not include illustrations intentionally because we do not want to support their time spent in front of the screen. It is better to draw children's attention to you, the sounds, and the story itself.

MEANINGFUL STORIES
We created Readmio because we believe in the power of stories. They form the basis of society and help to spread and maintain wisdom. For children, they are an ideal tool not only for expanding vocabulary but also for explaining complicated topics. We recommend that you use our stories as a conversation starter for topics you care about. You will find inspiration on how to get started in the descriptions of the individual stories.

ABOUT PRIVACY
An internet connection is required to download the fairy tale, but not for the reading itself. Speech recognition works completely offline on your device. No data or voice recordings are stored or transferred anywhere. Your privacy comes first. In addition, you can read on the go or abroad without worrying about expensive roaming charges.

We believe that you and your little ones will enjoy the application and have many magical experiences together.",2020-12-25T08:00:00Z,2025-11-18T12:31:53Z
