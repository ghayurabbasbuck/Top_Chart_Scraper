Originally built by a dad on parental leave (still with us btw!) for him and his not-so-sleepy baby girl, Napper has now grown to help more than 100,000 families sleep better. So whatever issue you might be facing - short naps, frequent night-wakings, never-ending bedtime routines - there’s a good chance we can help you too.

→ Napper’s main features include…

• A personalized sleep schedule for your baby based on their natural sleep rhythms and research on infant sleep. The schedule adjusts as your baby's sleep needs change to promote healthy sleep habits and provide them with the restful sleep they need to grow and develop.

• User-friendly, straight-forward baby tracker to help you keep track of nursings, formula feedings, diaper changes and much more. You can also share your baby (and subscription) with as many caregivers as needed so everyone is on the same page.

• A large variety of sleep sounds, such as white noise, lullabies, and sounds of nature, that can be played in the background during naptime and bedtime. The sounds are carefully chosen to be gentle and calming, helping to create a peaceful and relaxing environment for your baby to sleep in.

• A comprehensive, science-based article series designed to help you establish healthy sleep habits for your baby. The course covers a wide range of topics, including the basic biological components of sleep, how to create a sleep-friendly environment and strategies for settling and soothing a fussy baby.

•  Trends & statistics presented in easy-to-read charts that give you useful insights, such as the average amount of time your baby spends asleep, the number of night wakings, and the duration of feedings. Easily spot and identify patterns and trends in your baby's sleep, which allows you to make adjustments to their sleep routine as needed.

All in all, we’d really like to think that Napper is the most complete baby sleep app out there. But don't just take our word for it though - here’s what other parents have to say about it:

""Great app, helped me work out when nap times should be and helped set a bedtime routine! Definitely recommend.""

""This is one of the apps which every mom or another caregiver should download straight away. Thanks to Napper I could develop a deeper understanding of my 4-months old sleep patterns. And now he falls asleep fast and without cries. Thank you!""

""I love Napper! I've used 4 other sleep tracking apps (paid for) and Napper has to be my favorite! I love the aesthetic of the layout and how accurate it is.""

""This app is amazing!! Very accurate for my son and has been for months. Great features to select number of naps and set bed time if trying to create a routine too.""

""My baby is 11 months and I use it all day every day. Keeps us on schedule""

""This app is really great, it's like a baby manual that comes with your child! I really love it.""

""Really useful, I'm sleep deprived and can't remember exactly what time everything happens! The predictive sleep feature is great. Developers very responsive to feedback""

""I LOVE Napper! I have used lots of baby trackers over my 4 kids and this one is hands down my favorite.""

""The app is pretty great but the customer service is even better! I thought I was locked out of my account and they contacted me and got me back in within minutes! This app has revolutionized how we care for our newborn.""

""This is the app that got us through the 4 months sleep regression! And I love that multiple caretakers can add track baby's sleep. Such a great help!""

So don't let sleepless nights and exhausted days be the norm - try Napper (yes, today!!) and give your baby the gift of restful, peaceful sleep!
