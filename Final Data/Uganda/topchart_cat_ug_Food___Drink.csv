Sweets are an important part of all festivals, functions, or any happy occasion. Every recipe is described with ingredients and step-by-step directions.

This application is very useful for preparing sweets at home. Try making sweets at home and adjust all fat, calories, sugar, and whatever as per your health, taste, and fat. If you are a sweet lover and want to avoid weight gain, you can try these recipes, and use your trans-fat-free oil and other healthy ingredients that are fresh and best at home. We can have sweets from the market, but we all feel that their ingredients are not good. The other reason is that they use the same oil again and again which increases the trans-fat level. When we cook the same at home, we don't repeat the same and change it after some time. There are many other reasons to make sweets at home, such as if you want to use sugar-free or specific organic sugar or specific ingredients, you can always adjust your recipe.
Now you can save a lot of time and effort and find that perfect sweet recipe you're looking for! No more need to flip through dozens of cookbook or magazine pages. A sumptuous meal is always incomplete without sweet dishes like gulab jamun kulfi or gajar ka halwa.
