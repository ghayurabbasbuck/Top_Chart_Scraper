*From the team at ORIGINATOR - the creators of the beloved Endless Alphabet and Sesame Street's Monster at the End of This Book and Another Monster....  Originator is a team of passionate artists and engineers dedicated to the best education+entertainment apps for kids.*

As a follow-up to Endless Alphabet, set the stage for early reading success with Endless Reader!  This app introduces ""sight words"", the most commonly used words in school, library, and children's books.  Kids need to recognize these words by sight in order to achieve reading fluency.  Recognizing sight words is advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling, cannot be sounded out using phonics knowledge, and often cannot be represented using pictures. 

Kids will have a blast learning sight words and their context and usage with the adorable Endless monsters.  Each word features an interactive word puzzle with letters that come alive, and then a sentence puzzle with words that become what they describe.  See the word ""dog"" as a barking dog, and the word ""up"" reach for the sky!

** NOTE: You must be online and have sufficient disk space while running the app to get all words in the app. **

Features:
- 6 words free to try with additional word packs available for purchase.
- Delightful animations reinforce sight recognition of words in a fun and interactive way.
- Word puzzles reinforce spelling using lower-case letters and the sentence puzzles teach definition and usage (in addition to sight recognition).
- 3D Touch on iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus makes letters and words react in an extra special way!
- Endless Reader was designed with your children in mind.  There are no high scores, failures, limits or stress.  Your children can interact with the app at their own pace.",2013-11-21T04:30:51Z,2022-08-11T20:02:07Z

Moreover, all our content is evidence-based!


Introduction
Can you administer first aid? Every year 7.6 million people are injured in an accident. With the updated First Aid app of the Belgian Red Cross Flanders, you always have reliable information on how to act in case of these accidents, both in an urban and rural context. Whether it's a snake bite, severe bleeding, choking, or fever, the app clearly tells you what to do in an emergency. You can also use the app for first aid in a road accident or when somebody fell into a pit and has broken limbs. With the official First Aid app of the Belgian Red Cross Flanders (in collaboration with your local Red Cross), you are always prepared for accidents and don't have to look far for reliable information in case of an emergency.

Download the app now to discover all the new features!



Which accidents and first aid situations?
The app offers help with the most common first aid situations. You will find written instructions for more than 80 situations in which first aid is necessary, such as hyperventilation, wasp stings, or a bloody nose


Not a hospital, but first aid
The app is primarily intended for emergencies that do not require immediate medical attention from a doctor but do require first aid. For each accident or situation, we indicate how you recognize the situation. Then we explain in clear steps what you can do yourself. Of course, we also indicate when it is wise to contact the doctor or the emergency room or to call the emergency number.


Note: The app does not indicate where AEDs hang.


Achieve your first aid certificate
The app is optimized for a blended learning approach (learning theory in the application and the practice in a shorter in-class training). Next to learning first aid content, you can also prepare for your online admission test to a 1-day in-class of practical first aid training at your local Red Cross organization. When you pass your exam in the 1-day in-class training, you will gain your basic first aid certificate!


The Belgian Red Cross Flanders
We are an independent volunteer organization. Through the Belgian Red Cross, we are part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Our mission is threefold:
-	Standing up for vulnerable people at home and abroad.
-	To be active in the field of disaster relief, self-reliance, and blood supply.
-	In all of this, we rely on volunteers as much as possible.


Evidence-based First Aid 
All the content delivered by the Belgian Red Cross Flanders is evidence-based and validated by the Center for Evidence-Based Practice (CEBaP). More info can be found here: https://www.cebap.org/",2024-02-16T08:00:00Z,2025-08-13T23:26:59Z
