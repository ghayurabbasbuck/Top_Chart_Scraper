This esteemed magazine was first published in 1938 on the auspicious day of Sharad Purnima, marking the beginning of a legacy that has inspired millions of readers over the decades.


Released on the 1st of every month, Swaminarayan Prakash has consistently served as a beacon of moral guidance, cultural enrichment, and spiritual enlightenment. Its primary aim is to instil and strengthen the values of shil (moral values), samskar (cultural refinement), bhakti (devotion), and upasana (worship) among its readers. For over eight decades, it has been a cherished resource for those seeking to deepen their connection to the teachings and principles of the Swaminarayan Hindu tradition.


This magazine holds the distinction of being the oldest and most historic publication within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya and the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. Its pages are filled with articles, insights, and stories that not only preserve the rich heritage of the Swaminarayan faith but also present its timeless messages of Hinduism and global faith traditions in a manner relevant to the challenges and opportunities of modern life.


One of the unique features of Swaminarayan Prakash is its integration with the Swaminarayan Satsang Patrika, a bi-weekly publication that was launched in 1955 by Brahmaswarup Yogiji Maharaj Swami Gyanajivandasji, one of the revered spiritual leaders of the Swaminarayan tradition. The Satsang Patrika served as a vital source of spiritual inspiration and practical guidance for devotees. In 2001, it was seamlessly incorporated into Swaminarayan Prakash, enriching its content and making it an even more comprehensive spiritual resource.


Recognizing the evolving needs of its global readership and the advances in technology, BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha has now introduced a modern digital version of Swaminarayan Prakash through this mobile application. This digital initiative is designed to make the magazine's invaluable content easily accessible to readers around the world, bridging the gap between tradition and technology.


The application retains the essence and integrity of the original magazine while adding the convenience and flexibility of a digital platform. With features such as quick navigation, searchable archives, and interactive content, the app is designed to cater to the needs of a diverse audience, including younger generations who are accustomed to digital media.


Through this application, readers can continue to explore the wisdom of the Swaminarayan tradition, gain inspiration for daily living, and stay connected to the vibrant activities and teachings of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. Whether you are a long-time reader or a newcomer seeking spiritual enrichment, this app offers a unique opportunity to engage with the profound messages of Swaminarayan Prakash in a way that is both meaningful and convenient.


For over 85 years, Swaminarayan Prakash has been more than just a magazine; it has been a spiritual companion for countless individuals. Now, with its digital transformation, it continues to uphold its mission of spreading values, fostering devotion, and nurturing the spirit of service across the globe.


We invite you to explore this application, delve into its timeless teachings, and be a part of this remarkable journey that connects the past, present, and future of the Swaminarayan tradition.",2024-12-07T08:00:00Z,2025-08-11T05:42:34Z
