ug,Uganda,Books,6018,15,1517378787,Kinyarwanda Bible(Biblia Yera),RAVINDHIRAN SUMITHRA,https://apps.apple.com/ug/app/kinyarwanda-bible-biblia-yera/id1517378787?uo=4,0.0,4.50758,132,Book,"The Kinyarwanda Bible (Bibiliya ya Kinyarwanda) is your daily scripture reading companion with the complete holy scriptures and your prayer guide. The Holy Bible (Bibiliya Yera) comes with both the new testament and the old testaments of the holy scriptures. 

Christianity was introduced to Rwanda primarily by European missionaries starting in the late 19th century. Initially, missionaries used European languages like French to spread their message and teach the Bible. They wanted to translate the Bible in its local language for people in Rwanda, so the Kinyarwanda Bible (bibiliya kinyarwanda) was found for the Christians in Rwanda.

The first attempt to translate the Bible into Kinyarwanda (Bibiliya mu Kinyarwanda) began in the early 20th century. But the entire Kinyarwanda Bible translation took several decades to complete. The New Testament into Kinyarwanda Sacred Book was published in 1952.

The Kinyarwanda Holy Bible (bibiliya yera kinyarwanda bible) played a significant role in the growth and spread of Christianity in Rwanda. The Kinyarwanda Scriptures were used for both personal devotion and church services. 

Engaging in Kinyarwanda Bible study, many Rwandan Christians have found solace and guidance by reading the verses. Many people will find reading comfortable, whereas some may prefer the audio Bible. Whether reading or listening, Bible verses will always give us peace, harmony, and guidelines for a way of life.
