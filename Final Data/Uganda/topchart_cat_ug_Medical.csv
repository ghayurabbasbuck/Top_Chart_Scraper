* Scientific Research *

The popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.

You can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.

* Full Version *

This is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:

- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.
- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.
- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.
- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.

* How to Use *

To generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:

- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).
- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).
- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).

The application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen.",2013-07-25T00:43:43Z,2021-05-12T01:09:43Z

[How to use Max:]
▸ Fetch your reminders! You can set personalized schedules—daily, on specific days, or at intervals.

▸ When Max's ""Woof Woof"" alarm sounds, chow down on your meds and hit the ""taken"" button.

▸ Max automatically records the medicine name and time, crafting a pawsitively awesome health journal.

▸ If there's no response to the timely push notification, Max will bark up your phone again.

[Recommended for:]
▸ From conception to 16 weeks of pregnancy
Folate plays a major role in cell creation. Running low on folate could lead to underweight pups, premature births, and a stunted growth spurt for the little ones. Don't gobble it all up at once, though—it might cause a tummy tumble. Max suggests a daily dose with his ""Pill Paws"" alert to keep things steady.

▸ Office pups glued to screens
If those peepers are feeling ruff every time you blink, fetch an eye drop prescription at the clinic. For severe cases, set Max's ""3-Hour Howler"" alarm on his reminder app to keep those peepers lubed up. Adding some lutein to the mix is a real tail-wagger, too.

▸ Diabetic dogs on meds
Did you know 1 in 10 adults is a diabetic doggo? Those taking diabetes meds might run low on Vitamin B. It's like the secret sauce for energy production in our bodies, so Max's reminder pack always includes this woof-tastic nutrient.

Stay barking healthy with Max's tail-wagging reminders!",2020-03-10T07:00:00Z,2024-07-13T18:26:10Z
