Добавьте в почту аккаунты из других почтовых клиентов: Яндекс.Почта, Microsoft Outlook, Gmail от Google, Hotmail, Rambler, Yahoo — и переключайтесь между ними в один клик.

Краткий пересказ длинного письма. Поручите нейросети в приложении Mail прочитать все длинные электронные письма и кратко пересказать вам контекст, чтобы не терять время.

Выгодные даты для отпуска в Календаре. Календарь подскажет, в какой месяц лучше уйти в отпуск и какие дни лучше в него включить — выберите вкладку «Год» и введите свою зарплату.

Управляйте уведомлениями о новых электронных письмах. Настройте только нужные пуши и сообщения в приложении Mail: выберите нужные папки и удобное время.

Аккаунты всех почтовых клиентов в одном приложении. Соберите все письма из почты в одном приложении — читайте входящие письма, которые приходят вам в Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail от Google, Яндекс.Почта, Hotmail, Rambler и Zimbra в один клик.

Планер для ваших дел. Встречи по работе, напоминания о важных датах, чек-листы, звонки. Ссылка на звонок — в один клик, когда добавляете встречу в рабочий календарь.

Облако — безопасное место для документов и фото. Облако Mail сохранит файлы из писем, найдёт сканы документов. Загрузите все фото и видео в Облако, чтобы освободить память смартфона.

Тёмный фон в приложении Mail для комфортной работы. Выберите яркую заставку для Облака для работы днем, а ночью используйте темный интерфейс для просмотра файлов в Почте.

Контакты из адресной книги и почтовых клиентов в вашем приложении. Выбирайте, кому отправить письмо — приложение Mail предложит контакты из адресной книги и всех аккаунтов в вашей почте.

Быстрые действия с письмом. Разбирайте письма в приложении и в браузере: отметьте новое электронное письмо как важное, переместите в новую папку, удалите или оставьте непрочитанным.

Powerful Yandex AI on your phone helps with everyday chores and tackles tasks for study, work, and creativity.

Explore what the neural network can do with Alice—everything you expect from a smart chat in Russian.

Alice AI is Yandex’s family of generative models that power Alice. It includes:
- Alice AI LLM — a language model for answering questions and generating text;
- Alice AI ART — an image model for creating visuals;
- Alice AI VLM — a multimodal vision-language model for analyzing images, answering questions, and solving image-related tasks.

Ask questions, write and edit text—the Alice AI neural network responds accurately and comprehensively, and can enrich answers with images and source links. Speak by voice or type in chat.

Work with files (DOC, DOCX, PDF, TXT), structure information, and turn it into clear, usable reports. The Alice AI assistant quickly extracts key insights.

Work with photos—recognize text in images, identify objects, and get fast visual analysis. The AI chat assistant can pull data from a receipt photo, explain what’s in a shot, and convert it into an editable text format for further use.

Solve complex problems—reasoning mode produces not just quick and detailed answers, but thoughtful conclusions. You get well-founded solutions with expert-level analysis.

Create compelling English-language copy, ask questions, translate, and edit. Yandex Alice’s AI assistant helps draft anything—from personal emails and school assignments to business proposals.

Find inspiration: generate new project ideas, run brainstorms, craft descriptions and messages, and build your own text templates. Let Alice handle the routine. The AI assistant can write a letter, a script for an event or talk, suggest a post title, or even a name for your pet.

Create images and AI video—Yandex ART generates visuals or animates photos on request. Alice helps you produce striking social posts, a logo, or a birthday card.

Use AI chat for professional work. The assistant helps with programming and code, offering multiple solution approaches. Alice AI teaches logic, explains logical problems clearly, and shares interesting facts. Get advice and recommendations on any topic—Alice answers in detail, suggests step-by-step actions, and helps you plan.

Ask questions, type text, attach photos, videos, and files—or talk through the camera in real time with Live Mode. With the Pro option, show Alice what you see in Live Mode and get instant answers and ideas. Just open the Alice AI app and point your phone’s camera at whatever you want to learn about.

Alice AI can be your guide to landmarks, your kitchen co-pilot for “what can I cook with this?”, or your stylist for picking shoes to match your trousers. Ask anything and switch topics as needed. The neural network keeps context, recognizes objects in the frame, and delivers fast, in-depth answers.",2024-10-13T07:00:00Z,2025-11-21T11:43:00Z
