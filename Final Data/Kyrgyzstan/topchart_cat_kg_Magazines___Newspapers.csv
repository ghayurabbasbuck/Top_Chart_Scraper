Many of us born in an online generation can only sigh in nostalgia at the glamour and wonder of print fashion magazines from the early 2000s. As the world moved online, the once iconic fashion media companies failed to evolve - they gave us lazy pdfs to browse on slow and buggy e-readers as Inst*gr*m took over to give us the fast immersive content we wanted. Their disinterest in the preservation of beauty online is clear and it’s time we had a new medium to explore and appreciate fashion for fashion’s sake. MDLA is an experiment to revive the glory of early fashion media re-imagined through powerful online media technology from present day.

MDLA Runway brings you a variety of powerful features you’d expect from a modern fashion runway viewer:

* Intuitive Interface - Flip through runway looks with a simple swipe or drag. Jump through to your favorite designer’s early years with just a tap and slide. No endless scroll, no ads, no interruptions

* Powerful Search - Search for your favorite collections down to their specific year and season. Find archive collections by your favorite designers from their early years and from labels they previously worked at. Don’t worry about typos or using shorthands - we know what you mean :)

* Lightning Fast - Browse high resolution look images from the runway loaded in a flash of a second

* Smart Boards - Generate moodboards based on any style, color or vibe even if its super descriptive. Automatically filter your favorite designer or label to collect powerful references in an instant.

* 3D Showcase - Play around with high resolution 3D captures of rare archive “grail” pieces complete with added context from its rich fashion history and references from its original collection for you to explore and learn

* Immersive Editorials - Explore our selection of hand-curated stories of iconic archive pieces, profiles of in vogue runway designers, lost fashion techniques and striking editorial campaigns

Our catalog features thousands of collections dating back to the early 90s from the most iconic names in fashion
Browse the archives from your favorite labels: Dior - Gucci - Louis Vuitton - Prada - Balenciaga - Saint Laurent - Margiela
As well as your favorite designers: Raf Simons - Rick Owens - Tom Ford - Alexander McQueen - Hedi Slimane - Virgil Abloh - Issey Miyake


MDLA is for high fashion followers, meticulous moodboard makers, archive fashion collectors, y2k fashion magazine enjoyers, small town gossip girl lovers, vintage fashion shoppers, aesthetics respecters, ‘it’ girls, clout guys, connoisseurs, hobbyists, tasteful amateurs and most importantly, you :)",2022-09-09T07:00:00Z,2025-11-08T01:26:30Z

kg,Kyrgyzstan,Magazines & Newspapers,6021,22,938083437,Сканворд.ру журнал Scanword.ru,Andrey Vesnin,https://apps.apple.com/kg/app/%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4-%D1%80%D1%83-%D0%B6%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB-scanword-ru/id938083437?uo=4,0.0,3.33333,3,Games,"Сканворды на русском языке без всяких сомнений уникальное явление в мире. Ни на каком другом языке вы не найдете столько литературных вопросов, вопросов с юмором, вопросов с контекстом происходящего в мире сегодня. И всё это в обычных кроссвордах, хотя, казалось бы, какая ерунда. Русский народ – народ слова. И любит своё слово, и держит своё слово, и относится к слову как к самому дорогому.

Сканворды в приложении разнообразные - попроще и посложнее, с фотографиями, с классическими вопросами или ассоциативными: «одним словом» либо «раз слово, два слово», как подсказки старца Фура. В любом журнале есть один англо-русский сканворд и один «дыркавнос», надеюсь, вы поймёте, почему его так назвали. На каждой странице вас встречает персонаж нашей весёлой семейки. Присоединяйтесь!

Все сканворды для читателя бесплатны. Это годовая коллекция: 52-53 номера по 20 сканвордов в каждом. Полный годовой арсенал сканвордов «съест» на телефоне около 50 Мбайт - картинки маленькие, текст - это текст. Мы ценим место на вашем телефоне.

Интернет для разгадывания не нужен. При условии, что сами сканворды уже на вашем телефоне. Каждую пятницу выходит новый номер журнала. Если вы оставили активной опцию «уведомление», то один раз в неделю в пятницу в 12-00 по местному времени придёт напоминание о новом номере. При входе в приложение загрузка нового журнала происходит автоматически и при её успешном завершении более не повторяется. Кроме того, можно загрузить или удалить на телефон поштучно любой из журналов, либо через «Настройки» скачать все журналы в один клик.

Основные возможности, в том числе доступ ко всем сканвордам, в приложении для читателя бесплатны. Банкет оплачивает рекламодатель. Ему разрешено иметь один узкий баннер на каждой странице + один показ межстраничной рекламы перед открытием сканворда. Наш рекламодатель не прерывает процесс разгадывания. Также рекламодатель щедро награждает читателя бесплатными подсказками за просмотр своих роликов. 

Любой читатель вправе, но не обязан, «перебить» рекламодателя, и: а) отключить рекламу навсегда, б) оформить подписку, которая на срок подписки отключает рекламу и даёт неограниченные подсказки, в) набрать подсказок на развес. Все эти возможности представлены на витрине в «Магазине».

Подписка - стандартный механизм Apple. 
1) Подписка возможна на три срока - неделя, месяц или год.
2) Подписка автоматически продлеваемая. Средства за возобновление подписки будут взиматься в течение 24 часов до конца текущего периода. 
3) Подписка подключается или отключается стандартно через iTunes, ссылка управления внизу. При желании отказаться от возобновления подписки пользователю необходимо это сделать не позднее, чем за 24 часа до конца текущего периода. При этом оплаченный период подписки отработает до конца.
