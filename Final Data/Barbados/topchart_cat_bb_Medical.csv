Number 1 in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and elsewhere! ***

This is the simplest-to-use contraction timer. The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.
If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.

With the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.

The birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.

It is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.

Use the features of the Breastfeeding application.

Breastfeeding and pumping:
- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;
- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;
- record the duration of feeding/pumping;
- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;
- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time
- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop

Liquids:
- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);
 -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;
- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);

Feeding (solid food):
- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);
- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers
- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);

Sleep:
- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;
- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines

Diapers: 
- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.

Measurements: 
- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;

Other features:
- edit or delete events as needed;
- set reminders for various events; 
- use the application in your native language;
- select your preferred units of measurement;
- view statistics;
- enter data for several children and twins;
- backup all of your data;

Also available in PRO-version:
- disable advertising;	
- auto backup every 24 hours;

*Reach your goals*

Starting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.

*What will you learn?*

With Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones.

Instead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in green in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.

*How to stay motivated and not forget*

Whether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.

It's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.

By using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.

Daily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can.",2017-08-17T01:03:12Z,2025-03-04T13:38:37Z
