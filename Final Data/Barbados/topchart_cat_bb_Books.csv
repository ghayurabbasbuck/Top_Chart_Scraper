Not Rejected Just Unwanted
All Raine Andrew wanted was a mate. She wanted a mate to love her and make her feel wanted. And when she turns 17, she gets her mate: soon-to-be-Beta Elijah Woods. He's a great guy. He's loyal to his pack, a straight-A student, and a very hard worker.
He sounds like the perfect mate, right? Raine thought so too, but there's just one problem: He doesn't want her.

Mated to My Bully
Amanda Stevens thought her problems were over when she got to college. No longer the shy, awkward teen she was in high school, Amanda felt this was her chance at making new friends and experiencing life. That was until she found out her high school Bully was attending the same college she was. Hudson Harlow. 
The moment that Hudson Harlow looked into the hazel eyes of Amanda Stevens, his wolf started to howl MATE! Why in the world would the Moon Goddess mate him to a human? But Hudson started to notice that this was no longer the girl that he tormented in High School. She'd changed. 
Hudson, knowing how awfully he treated Amanda in high school, had to now convince her to forgive him and accept him as her mate. 
Not only did Amanda have to deal with Hudson, but she also had to juggle her classes, a new job, and strange animal attacks on campus. All Amanda wanted was a normal college life.

His Broken Luna
Battered, abused, and broken, Sophia Alden is resigned to living the rest of her life as a slave to Alexander, a powerful Alpha who considers her his property and is dangerously obsessed with her. 
But when the Alpha of the most powerful pack comes to claim his true mate, hearts are broken, dangerous enemies are made, and Sophia finds herself thrust into a world of lies, lust, secrets, and desires that threatens to douse her in its burning flame, consuming her entire being.

All of these and more will be at your fingertips. Download Readict today!
