This app is the perfect resource for those who want to study and explore the Orthodox Christian faith. With the Orthodox Bible app, you can access the full text of the Old and New Testament. The app also includes daily readings and a Orthodox Calendar of feasts and fasts, making it easy to stay connected to your faith every day.

The translation of the Old Testament from the Septuagint into English is a process that involves both linguistic expertise and a deep understanding of the historical and cultural context of the original texts. The Septuagint, often abbreviated as LXX, is an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Old Testament, which holds significant importance in the history of biblical scholarship. 

Use this app to track the dates of other religious holidays in the  Orthodox calendar such as Christmas, Epiphany, Theophany, and the Dormition of the Theotokos. These holidays are based on the liturgical Orthodox calendar, which is a cycle of readings and liturgical services that are used in the Orthodox churches. The liturgical Orthodox Calendar follows the same patterns and themes throughout the year, and it is closely tied to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Why follow the Orthodox calendar: mindfulness and introspection, humility recognizing one's own smallness in the grand scheme of God's plan and purpose.

 - Build discipline and routine in one's spiritual practice
-  Foster a deeper sense of connection to the divine
- Take time to reflect on the sacrifices and teachings of Jesus Christ by observing religious holidays
- Foster a sense of community and shared spiritual practice with other Eastern Orthodox believers.

The Orthodox calendar, also known as the Julian calendar, is the calendar used by many Eastern Orthodox churches around the world to determine the dates of religious holidays and observances. It is based on the Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC and is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. The Orthodox calendar has different dates for Easter and other religious holidays, which are based on the liturgical calendar. It is an important part of the religious tradition and culture of the Eastern Orthodox churches. The Orthodox calendar is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used in the Western world. This difference is due to the fact that the Orthodox churches did not adopt the Gregorian calendar, which was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a reform of the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar has a leap year rule that eliminates the accumulated error of the Julian calendar, so the Orthodox church still use the Julian calendar. The Orthodox calendar follows the same month names as the Julian calendar, which are: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December. However, the Orthodox calendar has different dates for Easter, which is the most important religious holiday for Christians. The Orthodox Easter is always celebrated on the Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox. This is different from the Western Easter, which is always celebrated on the Sunday following the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox.
