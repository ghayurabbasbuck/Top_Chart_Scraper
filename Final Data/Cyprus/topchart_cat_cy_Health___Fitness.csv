COSMETIC SAFETY SCANNER
With OnSkin, you have a seasoned digital cosmetologist by your side. Choose from three ways to get a product’s safety profile—take a photo of it, scan its barcode, or look up its name on the app. OnSkin will see past the glitz and glamor and decipher the Latin names on the label in a clear way, flagging any potentially harmful components. Plus, the app recommends cleaner alternatives to help you look and feel healthier inside and out.

SCIENCE IS OUR INFLUENCER
The OnSkin product ratings are 100% unbiased—we don’t partner with any brands. Our in-house team of biologists and physicians have used the latest scientific research on toxicology and dermatology to assess over 15,000 cosmetic ingredients. Using an AI calculating algorithm and human curation, we rate products promptly while preserving the quality of manual analysis.

PERSONALIZED SKINCARE TIPS
Just complete a short survey about your skin to get essential care steps and active ingredients to look for when hunting for new products, all tuned to your unique skin and curated by our skin experts. These may be a great kickoff for starting a substantial skincare routine or double-checking your existing one.

SKIN MATCH
Finding suitable products for your skin (especially if it’s acne-prone and sensitive) can be quite a puzzle, but with OnSkin, you’ll always know if a product is a perfect match, a potential match, or not a match for you. Based on the info you input about your skin type and skincare goals, we check how well a product is tailored to your skin needs, so you can invest in effective formulas without having to experiment with your face.

PRODUCT REVIEWS
Viral products seem tempting to give a shot, but how do you check whether it's all just hype before you rush to Sephora? Every week, you’ll see compilations of the top 10 most buzzy products from various categories, from washes to serums. For each, you’ll learn about the powerful and questionable ingredients and their effects, all explained in simple terms. Plus, our skin experts will weigh in on whether it's good value for money! You get to see the real face of raved-about skincare and pick items based on their effects, not just their popularity.

POPULAR SCANS
See what products are trending on the app and discover new faves!

GUESS THE SCORE
Test your cosmetic intuition with this quick, fun daily game. Is a product’s safety score above or below 50? Pick it right and get a chance to win Premium and scan products without limits!

Trusted by 16 million users who want to reconnect with their bodies and feel better, featured by the App Store in Apps We Love, and collaborating with 25+ universities worldwide — including Harvard Medical School, Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins — to advance health science.

— Your heart knows everything about you. Welltory helps you listen and understand —

Sometimes your body feels like it’s speaking a foreign language. Welltory translates those signals into science-backed insights — whether you’re facing hormonal changes, heart health concerns, fatigue, burnout, or just want to optimize energy and mood.

We analyze heart rate variability (HRV) — a proven heart health marker backed by 20,000+ studies — to show what your heart and nervous system reveal about your wellness.

— Your Complete Health Story, One App —

You don’t have to piece together insights from 5 health apps. When you finally have a moment for yourself, everything you need is right there. 

Connect 1,000+ devices and apps — Apple Watch, Oura, meditation apps, lab test results, and more — to create your personal health diary. 

— Stop Guessing. Start Understanding —

Sleep That Actually Restores You

Struggling with insomnia or waking up exhausted? Our Sleep Analysis goes beyond counting hours. Discover what disrupts your rest and get insights to improve recovery. With Echo — a science-based library of calming content tailored to your heartbeat — you’ll fall asleep faster and wake up truly restored.

Heart Health & Blood Pressure Simplified 

Your heart reveals what’s really happening in your body. Welltory helps you track blood pressure, hypertension, and other metrics — plus log symptoms in your personal health diary. Share reports with your doctor, or use Welltory as a tracker helping you navigate health, menopause, and aging with confidence.

Can Apple Watch measure blood pressure? No, but Welltory helps you understand your numbers if you sync a monitor or add data manually.

Stress That Makes Sense

Turn your Apple Watch into a stress monitor and catch stress before it takes over. No more wondering “why am I so stressed?” — now you’ll know, and know how to respond. See how work, sleep, workouts, and even Zoom meetings affect your stress levels, and recognize when it’s time to pause and restore balance.

Activity Boost Without Pressure

Track the 60% of activity most fitness apps ignore — we count every effort: walking the dog, house chores, running for the bus, and more. Every activity grows your Mountain in the app — the taller it gets, the more you’ve moved. We also set a Longevity goal that matches where your body is today and gently guides you toward progress, not perfection.

Start listening to your body — and feel the difference with Welltory.
