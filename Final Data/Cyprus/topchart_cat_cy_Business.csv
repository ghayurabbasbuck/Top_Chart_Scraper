Snap a photo, AI auto-fills customs details (or enter your own), pay in your currency, and get a QR code/Declaration ID for U.S. shipping.

Easily calculate and prepay U.S. duties with Zonos Prepay. Just snap a picture of the items you’re shipping, and our AI fills in the customs details for you, including calculating duty cost. Review/edit the information, pay instantly in your own currency, and ship with confidence. Prefer to enter your item information manually? That’s supported too (no photo required).

Currently compatible with Canada Post (Full guide: https://zonos.com/docs/guides/shipping-via-posts/zonos-and-canada-post/zonos-prepay) and USPS (U.S. territories).

Why Zonos Prepay:
- Free account (no subscription costs).
- Prepay duties when required to continue shipping postal to the U.S.
- Save time with auto-filled customs declarations based on a quick photo (or manually enter the item information yourself, if preferred)
- Get accurate, guaranteed duty and tax totals with HTS codes. Neither you nor your recipient will have to pay additional duties, even if customs re-assess your shipment.
- Pay as you go: Pay a clearance/processing fee per shipment, along with the duty cost
- Get a QR code & Declaration ID for smooth shipping.
- 18 languages, local currencies and payment methods.

How It Works:
1. Create a free account.
2. Select the post you are shipping with (currently supports USPS for U.S. territories and Canada Post).
3. Click “Add items manually” to enter your item information yourself, or click “Take a picture” to take a photo and have the app auto-populate your item information. You can include all items in one photo, or take multiple photos. Note: Only include items that are shipping within the same box. If you are shipping multiple boxes, only enter and pay for one box at a time, so you get a Declaration ID for each box.
4. Review/edit the item information, then click “Calculate duties” to get the duty costs and associated processing/clearance fees for your shipment.
5. Pay in your own currency. Payment covers both duties and the clearance/processing fee.

“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“
