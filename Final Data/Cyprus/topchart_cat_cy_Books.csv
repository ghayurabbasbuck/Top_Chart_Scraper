It’s now easier to read the Quran on the go, memorize it and listen to your favorite reciters.

This is just the beginning for Quran for iOS. We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com

As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.

This style reflects the cultural and linguistic influences of the Somali language on the recitation of the Quran.

Explore our iOS Quran app, designed for easy access to the Holy Quran on Apple devices. Our Somali Quran application is designed in an English format, making it accessible and user-friendly for individuals who are not familiar with the Arabic language. The Holy Quran consists of 30 Juz (parts) and 114 Suras (chapters).

The Quran in Somali Language has been predominantly oral, passed down through generations of Quran teachers (known as ""Ustaads"") to their students. This oral tradition has preserved not only the words of the Quran but also the specific intonations and melodies associated with Somali Quran recitation.

The Somali language's phonetic and tonal characteristics influence the way verses of Quran are recited. While Somali translation recitation has its own unique style, it adheres to the principles of Tajweed.

Reciting the sacred books of the Muslims is a duty that all Muslims should attempt to fulfill. It allows devout followers within the religion to gain inner peace, rewards, and approval from Allah.

Studying Tafsir enables you to grasp the Quran’s messages and deeper meanings. Understanding the words of our creator brings us nearer to Him, as expressed in the Quranic verse.

С вами Буквоед, Знаковые книжные. Почему Знаковые? Уже больше 20 лет Буквоед делает чтение доступнее: помогает ориентироваться в мире литературы, знакомит с авторами, играет важную роль в культурной жизни Петербурга.

А это мобильное приложение, где книголюбы могут найти:

• Тысячи историй, сувениров, канцтоваров и подарков. Быстро и бесплатно привезём ваш заказ в магазины Буквоеда и Читай-города, а ещё доставим курьером, Почтой России, в постаматы и ПВЗ.

• Программу лояльности Книголов для Знаковых Читателей: она действует в Буквоеде, Читай-городе, book24.ru и Литрес. Возвращайте до 15% от заказа бонусами, которыми можно оплатить до 100% с покупок.

• Рекомендации, чтобы не заблудиться в книжном многообразии. Например, литературные подборки, а ещё сервис «Я в магазине». Он подскажет, где стоит интересующий вас сюжет и предложит истории по запросу. 

• Подарочные сертификаты — их можно обменять на любые истории, сувениры, настольные игры и даже сладости. 

• Информацию о действующих скидках, предложениях от издательств и других акциях.

Нам есть куда ещё стремиться – пока обзоры новинок и расписание встреч с авторами доступны только на сайте bookvoed.ru. Но разделы будут постепенно появляться и здесь со следующими обновлениями.

Будем рады вашим отзывам и предложениям о том, что нужно изменить и добавить в первую очередь: customer@bookvoed.ru. 

До встречи в Знаковых книжных!",2014-09-06T00:57:47Z,2025-11-20T12:14:18Z
