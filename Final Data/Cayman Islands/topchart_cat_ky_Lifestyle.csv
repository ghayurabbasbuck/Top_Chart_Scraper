If you're thinking about buying property or finding homes to rent with ease and safety, you've come to the right place. With cutting-edge technology, Artificial Intelligence, and a fully digital process, we help you find houses and apartments with more convenience and efficiency.

Rent with no guarantor, no deposit, and no hassle
When renting a home, you don’t need to worry about guarantors, rental insurance, or security deposits. Here, bureaucracy gives way to simplicity: the entire rental process is done online and transparently—from choosing the property to signing the contract. Best of all, you’ll have the support of a specialized team that’s with you every step of the way.

Looking to buy? Get full support
If you want to buy property, we also offer a simplified experience. Our consultants assist you in everything—from finding the perfect house or apartment to negotiating directly with the owner. We also help with the more bureaucratic parts, such as document review.

AI-powered search: describe the home you want, we’ll find it
One of the biggest innovations on our platform is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in property search. In addition to using traditional filters, you can now describe in writing or by voice exactly what you're looking for—like “apartment with hardwood floors and natural lighting” or “modern house for rent with a balcony and open kitchen.” Our AI understands your preferences and finds properties based on image details, analyzing elements like flooring type, wall colors, design style, and more. It’s the intelligent, personalized search you’ve always wanted.

Professional photos and optimized visits
Don’t waste time with poor listings or unnecessary visits. On QuintoAndar, all homes available for rent or purchase come with professional photos, 360-degree images, and detailed videos—so you can explore every detail before scheduling a visit. And if you like what you see, you can even make a rental offer directly through the app, without waiting for the visit to end.

Faster offers and negotiations
Want to move quickly? Submit your offer in just a few clicks and negotiate directly with the property owner. If you're buying, our experts step in to help you negotiate the best price, with complete transparency and professional support throughout the process.

High-quality service and ratings
After every visit, you can rate the agent who assisted you. This feature ensures you always receive top-quality service from professionals who truly understand the market and your needs.

Daily personalized recommendations
Based on your favorites, we send daily, tailored suggestions for homes and apartments similar to the ones you've already shown interest in. That way, you never miss an opportunity to find your ideal property—and you save time with a curated selection made just for you.

Listing a property? Rely on Qpreço Intelligence
If you're a property owner looking to sell or rent out your property, you can also count on advanced technology. With Qpreço Intelligence, we analyze thousands of similar listings, taking into account location, property features, market behavior, and real-time data. This allows us to suggest the ideal price so you can list with confidence, fairness, and a better chance of closing a deal quickly.

The smart choice for those who want speed and trust
With all these unique features, QuintoAndar stands out from traditional real estate agencies. Whether you're buying property, renting, or searching for the perfect home to rent, we offer a digital, intuitive, and secure experience—with total focus on you.
