• Coffee & food
You haven't cooked and you're hungry. We’ve been there. You woke up, and there's no way you’re getting up without a coffee. We get it. You always study late at night, but a chocolate-banana-cookie crepe could take your productivity to the next level. We totally understand. So, how can we help?
 - Quick order: Through “Order again”, easily find and repeat your previous orders.
 - Special selections: With Chef Leonidas Koutsopoulos, we created the Red Selection – a curated list of restaurants offering something special. We suggest taking a look. Or two. 

• Supermarket
Why go to the supermarket, when the supermarket can come to you? Forget the heavy bags, the checkout lines, and wandering through endless aisles.

Tap on the relevant category on efood and check out efood market — efood’s very own supermarket. Discover your favorite supermarket chains (SKLAVENITIS, AB, My market, Kritikos, BAZAAR, Carrefour and more) and choose whatever you want, at the same prices as in-store.

 - You choose the delivery time: Place your order and pick the day and time that works best for you. Yep, there are supermarkets open on efood, daily, even on Sundays.

Discover flower shops, liquor stores, pharmacies, greengrocers, butcher shops, fish shops, delicatessens, bookstores, technology products, bio products, optical stores, fitness options, and pet shops. What else do you want? We can bring that too!

 - Forgot a birthday or anniversary? No worries - order flowers, books, or anything else you’d like, and surprise your loved ones with a gift!

Our goal is to help you enjoy everything efood has to offer every single day. Discover how you can make the most of it.
