“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“

Pricing and subscriptions

MobiOffice offers an auto-renewable yearly subscription for $39.99 per year.

The price corresponds to the same price segment, which is set in the ""Apple's App Store Matrix"" for other currencies. 

• Your free trial subscription will automatically renew to a paid subscription unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial period.

• Any unused portion of a free trial period (if offered) will be forfeited when you purchase a premium subscription.

• You can cancel a free trial or subscription anytime by turning off auto-renewal through your iTunes account settings, 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free service.
