Clone, edit, commit and push while allowing other apps access to repositories.

Git is a important part of our work-life and iOS can take part in this. The ability to commit even when offline has added utility on a device that moves in and out of network coverage. Cloning repositories gets you a local copy on your iOS device with commits for all branches. You can browse the content from within the app and make changes. Other applications supporting the Files app, WebDAV or x-callback-url has access to these files. Changes made can be committed and the commits can in turn be pushed back to the remote.

The idea of doing significant programming on iOS might seem far fetched when you are used to a large screen, a physical keyboard and a full IDE. But just as it turned out that not every email is serious prose, then not everything that goes on in Git is significant programming. Sometimes you just want to update a TODO file or make adjustments to your Jekyll site. Sometimes you just need to add a file the designer sent after hours. 

If you ever make reminders about small things to do with the code-base, then you should give Working Copy a try. You will spend less time moving stuff around and you will get much better commit messages when you write them for fixes that are still fresh in your mind. You won't be leaving your computer behind any time soon, but sometimes it is faster to just fix things with the device in your hand.

When you do need to perform real work on iOS, Working Copy is a powerful tool. Editor has syntax highlighting for more than 50 programming languages and a built-in color picker. Preview images, Markdown and HTML files with a Javascript console pointing to errors in your code. Create new branches and merge or rebase them back, with a brilliant merge-tool for handling conflicts. If you need to automate your work there are Working Copy actions in the Shortcuts app for most operations.

Even if you never edit a line of code on iOS, Working Copy is a great companion for reviewing and discussing code. Repositories are cross indexed and with powerful fuzzy search you can quickly jump from a symbol to the declaration or reverse from the declaration to all usages. A graph of your commits lets you zoom out for a overview of the commit tree or zoom in for specifics about each commit, with speed and beauty you won’t find in desktop Git applications. Review the changes your files have gone through with a diff viewer that is great for text and images. There is even hex-dump mode for that obscure occasion.

Working Copy is a free download but you need to unlock pro features such as the ability to push commits and manage more than 5 repositories. There is no venture capital, large company or ads funding development and your support through in-app purchase directly sustains development. Try out pro features with a 10 day free trial.

When you pay to unlock you get permanent access to all pro features at the time of purchase as well as any added the next year.

WebSSH is a powerful and user-friendly SSH, SFTP, Telnet, and Port Forwarding client for iOS and macOS. It allows developers, system administrators, and IT professionals to manage servers securely and efficiently, wherever they are.

With WebSSH, you can connect to your servers using modern authentication methods including password, two-factor challenge, or keys (RSA, DSA, ED25519, PuTTY). Connections are fast and reliable, with support for local port forwarding, automatic command execution at startup, and full terminal emulation (XTERM-COLOR256, XTERM, VT100). Profiles let you customize themes, colors, fonts, and keyboard behavior to perfectly fit your workflow.

Managing files on remote servers is simple thanks to the integrated SFTP client. You can browse directories, create or rename files, upload documents from your device, download files locally, and even edit text files directly within the app.

Beyond SSH and SFTP, WebSSH also supports Telnet and Serial connections, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of use cases. Serial connections can be fully configured (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, flow control), while Telnet connections support both direct and interactive authentication.

For quick diagnostics, WebSSH includes built-in sysadmin tools such as Ping, Whois, Traceroute, and DNS Lookup. And if you need a terminal even without internet access, the mashREPL feature gives you a local shell with essential commands like ls, grep, curl, ping, tar, and many more.

WebSSH supports multiple protocols (SSH, SFTP, Telnet, Serial) and channel types (Shell sessions, SFTP sessions, Local Port Forwarding), ensuring compatibility with most professional scenarios.

Why WebSSH?

Unlike basic terminal clients, WebSSH combines professional-grade features with a polished, mobile-first design. It is secure, reliable, and easy to use — the all-in-one solution to keep your servers close at hand, no matter where you are.
