DroneMap je jediná aplikace v ČR, která provozovatelům, pilotům, ale i široké veřejnosti poskytuje garantovaná data od Řízení letového provozu ČR. Díky ní budete vždy vědět, za jakých podmínek můžete na vybraném místě bezpečně vzlétnout. Aplikace je určena všem pilotům dronů – od začátečníky po profesionály.

Hlavní výhody DroneMap:
-	Oficiální a garantovaná data: přehled o aktuálním rozdělení vzdušného prostoru a zeměpisných zónách
-	Interaktivní mapa: Přehledná vizualizace zón, včetně podmínek provozu bezpilotních letadel, které v nich platí. 
-	Plánování letů: Možnost vytvoření uživatelského profilu a správa vlastních dronů včetně plánování letů.
-	Meteodata: Aktuální i budoucí meteorologické informace relevantní pro provoz dronů.
-	Detekce konfliktů: Upozornění, že je let plánován v prostoru, kde platí přísnější podmínky provozu dronů.

Aplikace je zdarma a snadno použitelná, zobrazení všech leteckých dat, zeměpisných zón a meteorologických dat je možné i bez předchozí registrace. Pro využití pokročilejších funkcí jako je plánování letů či detekce konfliktů je však registrace nutná- nezabere vám víc než 2 minuty a umožní vám využívat všechny nové funkce!
