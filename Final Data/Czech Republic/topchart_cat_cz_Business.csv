Carry the whole job market in your pocket and search for a job. Anytime, anywhere. Fed up with commuting? Download the app and join Jobs Round the Corner!

Why this app?
- Job offers you won’t find anywhere else. Small family business? Multinational corporation? There’s something there for everyone.
- Job offers from A to Z! No matter what type of job you’re looking for, you’ll be spoiled for choice. We have tons of administrative, sales, and manufacturing job offers.
- Rev up your job search from your fingertips. You’ll be showered with leads in no time. When you react to a listing, you’ll get a reply within 11 hours on average. Businesses usually call, so you may want to have your phone with you.
- We’ll keep an eye on the best offers for you. If a new listing in your neighbourhood comes out, you’ll get a notification. We’ll recommend relevant offers to you based on your search and reply history.
 
How do I find my dream job just round the corner? 
- Job hunting with us is easy as pie.
- For starters, we need to know your address to know which corner to search around! 
- Arrange your job offers based on two criteria: Closest or Latest.
- Customize your search results with filters: distance from your home, monthly salary, full-time/part-time, and occupation.
 
How do I reply to a job offer that caught my eye? 
- Directly from the app!
- What a company needs is your personal details, e-mail address, and phone number. Don’t forget to upload your CV or briefly describe your professional background in the app.
- You’ll provide this information once. The next time you reply, this data will be prefilled for you.

How do I contact the company? 
- Once you reply to a job listing, we notify the business which gets access to your contact details, professional background, and CV.
- Companies mostly call, but they can also send you a direct message or email you.
- Any questions? Ask them in a direct message that pops up once you reply to the listing.
- The app shows you the status of your application: if your reply was seen, if the company attempted to call you, if you were advanced to the next round, etc.
- You can call the business, too. Or text them.

What else can I do in the app?  
- Check your reply history anytime. 
- Mark relevant job offers you can’t reply to immediately. You’ll be reminded to reply to them later with a notification.
- Forward selected job offers to your friends who might be interested.
