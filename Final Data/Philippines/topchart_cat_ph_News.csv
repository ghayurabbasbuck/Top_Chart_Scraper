Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social media network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps maintain content quality and community standards.



Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.

Responsible Gambling:
Lottery can be a form of entertainment for some, but it's essential to practice responsible play. Set a budget before participating and only spend what you can afford to lose. Remember, the odds of winning are usually low, and it's crucial to view lottery games as a recreational activity rather than a reliable way to earn money. If you ever feel that lottery is becoming a problem, seek help and support from loved ones or a professional organization specialized in gambling addiction.

The app does not sell tickets nor able users to participate nor to bet on the lotteries. This is an App Store rule that doesn’t allow gambling in any apps in the store. This app is for ages 18 and older.
