This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!

How it is working:

• User A wants to know a User B location.

• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.

• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.

• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.

Limitations:

• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.

• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).

• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.

The user location is determined in three ways:

• E.123, E.164
• RIR
• W3C Geolocation API
