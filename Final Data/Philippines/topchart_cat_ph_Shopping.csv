What exactly is Cashback? Where does the money come from?

If you love shopping online, you’re probably always looking for a good deal. Cashback, coupon codes and browser extensions all help you save money, and you've come to the right place!

So, what is Cashback? When you click through ShopBack to our partners, we give you a portion of your spending back. Stores pay us commissions for sending our members to their platforms, and we share that with you in the form of Cashback. It's a win-win, and a great way to earn money while shopping online! 

The best part about getting Cashback is, of course, cashing out. Get yourself some extra money to shop more! 

How do you get Cashback?
Sign up for your free ShopBack account and browse on our app, website or browser extension to find what you love.
Click through ShopBack to be redirected to the store’s site. Shop, apply the coupon code that you’ve found on our site, and pay as you normally would. 
Cashback will be tracked in your ShopBack account and ready to be withdrawn once the store and ShopBack have verified your purchase.

What if you found an item in our app and wanted you to know if it’s available in any of our stores? We have the answer to that — use our FIND IN STORE feature! This feature will show you all available sizes and colours and where we currently have them in stock.

Our app also comes handy when you’re already inside one of our stores.
Let’s say you can’t find your size or would like to know if an item is available in more sizes and colours? Scan the price tag — our SCAN & FIND feature will let you know!

Seen something you like and got inspired by? VISUAL SEARCH lets you explore what we have to offer by using your own photos or screen shots. It recognizes patterns, colors, styles, and gives you a list of matching or similar items in stock.

Save the items you love the most in your own list of favourites — just tap the HEART ICON. 

Turn the H&M app into your own shopping tool — activate IN-STORE MODE when you visit one of our stores. See which of your favourite-marked items are available in the store you’re in, or nearby.

Keep up to date with the fashion world by activating PUSH NOTIFICATIONS! You’ll be the first to know when a designer collection drops and you’ll instantly be notified when we have special offers and events!

Ltd.,https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/carousell-snap-sell-chat-buy/id548607187?uo=4,0.0,4.83985,109497,Shopping,"Carousell is the leading multi-category classifieds and recommerce marketplace in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia that lets you sell and buy everything including fashion, luxury, mobile phones, books, toys, cars, motorcycles, home services (renovation, cleaning, movers) and more.

We dream of a world where people instinctively sell their under-utilised items instead of letting them go to waste, and where others buy them as a first choice. Hence, Carousell was started to make buying and selling preowned items easier. 

To sell, simply take a photo to start listing on the marketplace and even start your online store. Too busy to list? You can also sell clothing, mobile phones, luxury bags and cars directly to Carousell*.

To buy, simply search for what you want. Shop secondhand mobile phones, luxury bags and cars with a peace of mind by looking for Carousell Certified listings with the ‘Certified’ tag^. Also look out for listings with the ‘Buyer Protection’ tag and ‘Buy’ button# which allows you to make purchases directly on the app via secure payment methods with escrow protection and access delivery options with popular logistics partners.
