No limits, no restrictions.

Simlo is a dedicated app for electronic data SIMs (eSIMs) that gives you a simple, flexible, and unrestricted connectivity experience. All Simlo data plans are truly unlimited — with no “fair usage” policy and no sudden speed drops after a certain limit.

Travel, browse, stream, and download freely without worrying about data limits or speed. This is the Internet you deserve when traveling.

Why choose Simlo?
• No fair usage policy  
• No data limits  
• No sudden speed reduction  
• No physical SIM cards  
• No waiting, shipping, or activation delays  
Everything is digital — activate your eSIM within minutes and stay connected anywhere in the world.

How to use the app:
1. Choose the plan that fits your destination and trip duration  
2. Install your eSIM on your device using the QR code  
3. Activate the plan and start using the Internet instantly  

Whether you're traveling to the Gulf, Europe, or anywhere around the world, you'll enjoy fast and reliable Internet — without worrying about disconnections or throttling.

What is “Fair Usage”?
Most providers advertise “unlimited” plans, but in reality, they limit your data after a certain amount through what’s known as a “Fair Usage Policy.” Once you reach that threshold, your Internet speed drops significantly.

At Simlo, we don’t follow this policy at all. Every Simlo plan gives you truly unlimited data at a stable speed — from the first megabyte to the last moment.

Where does Simlo work?
Simlo covers over 170 destinations worldwide, including:

• Gulf Region: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain  
• Arab World: Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia  
• Europe: France, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden  

24/7 Support
Our dedicated support team is available 24/7 to help you anytime. Whether you need assistance with activation or face any technical issue, we’re here to guide you step by step.

We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.

inDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers.
 
But now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.

The main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. 

What We Offer

CITY RIDES
Affordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.

INTERCITY RIDES
A safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. 

COURIER SERVICES
This door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.

FREIGHT SERVICES
Book a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.

Why choose inDrive
QUICK AND EASY
It's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points ""A"" and ""B"" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.

OFFER YOUR FARE
inDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.

CHOOSE YOUR DRIVER
inDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.

STAY SAFE
See the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the ""Share Your Ride"" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.

ADD TRAVEL OPTIONS
Do you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like ""traveling with my pet,"" “I have luggage,"" etc.

SIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY
If you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.
Best of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!
