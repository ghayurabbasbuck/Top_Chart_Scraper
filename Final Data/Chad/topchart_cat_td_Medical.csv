It is an opportunity for students and both emerging and experienced doctors to acquire new skills by looking at the work being performed. At the same time there is a live chat giving the possibility to discuss and give suggestions to the surgeon operating. 
Any medical or dentistry graduate can choose to share either videos or live sessions of their work.
The live stream option allows the viewer to see the live images from the surgical field including any additional imaging viewed by the operator (X-rays, CT, or even another camera in the operating room to check what another surgeon is doing). Through special icons there is also the possibility to draw and point at something on the surgical area. This will be seen by the surgeon carrying out the operation and can be implemented by some indications through the chat option. The surgeon can, at any time, remove these elements from his view.
This creates a live experience for both the viewer and the surgeon which can take a great advantage of the live connection with other experts on the subject to keep improving his work.",2022-10-27T07:00:00Z,2025-02-24T06:39:52Z
