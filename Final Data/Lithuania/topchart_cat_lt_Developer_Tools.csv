We’ve developed the ASO Toolkit app for indie iOS developers whether they are completed beginners or seasoned pros at optimising their app for the App Store. There are tips and guides for where to get started in the world of App Store Optimization and tools to view rankings, analyse metadata and more for advanced users.


ASO Toolkit contains these great features:

METADATA

View your app’s existing metadata on the App Store and compare it against other apps to see which has the highest ASO Score. If your app has a poor ASO Score, we’ll offer you suggestions on how you can improve it.

There’s no need to leave the app to get started with new metadata, you can create drafts that will allow you to prototype different metadata variations. Once you’re happy with a draft, you can complete the draft and upload it directly to App Store Connect. Drafts can be localised in all App Store languages too.


KEYWORDS

The ASO Toolkit has full support for viewing your app’s keyword rankings in any App Store country. Keywords you’ve tracked will show trend movements over the past 7 days but you can drill down to an individual keyword to view rankings for up to the past year and even compare them on a graph with your competitor apps too.


CATEGORY RANKINGS

Ever wanted to see where your app ranks in different countries? The Category Rankings tool allows you to add any combination of countries to instantly view category rankings all on one screen. You can even compare rankings with your competitors too.


APP OVERVIEW

Quickly access all of your app’s core metrics using the App Overview. You’ll be able to see your app’s ASO Score, keyword trends, current category ranking and more with just a glance. The App Overview also makes it easy to manage your competitors and see more details about your app too. You’ll be able to give your app a custom name to make it easier to find and even set the default country and language from here too.


STOREFRONT SWITCHER

The Storefront Switcher allows you to quickly change the country that the App Store is using on your device. This is useful for quickly seeing if your app has been featured in other countries that you wouldn’t normally be able to access.


ASO GUIDES & TIPS

We believe strongly in educating everyone on ASO so we’re pleased to include some guides and tips to allow ASO beginners to get started in optimising their apps.


APP STORE CONNECT API

The ASO Toolkit supports linking with your App Store Connect account to get access to the ability to quickly add apps in your account to the ASO Toolkit. You’ll also be able to view metadata from App Store Connect and then upload new drafts too. When you’re done, you can then submit builds for review - all without leaving the app.


WIDGETS & SIRI SHORTCUTS

With our Widgets, you’ll be able to quickly view category and keyword rankings from your Home Screen without launching the app. There’s even support for switching App Store countries from the Widgets too. Each Widget has a corresponding Siri Shortcut too so you’ll be able to just ask Siri to view rankings or switch countries.


RATINGS & REVIEWS

The Ratings & Reviews tool allows you to see how users are perceiving your app. You’ll be able to see the star rating, a breakdown by stars and the reviews left by each user.


APP UPDATES

Using the App Updates tool, you’ll be able to see the most recent updates you have made to your app and when it was released.


CREATIVES

You’ll be able to see all of your app’s screenshots and the app icon in more detail using the Creatives tool.


OTHER TOOLS

We have a few other tools to help you get started with ASO too: Keyword Lookup, Metadata Prototype & Top Charts.


SAVED APPS

All of your apps you’ve saved on one device and corresponding metadata, keywords and more will automatically sync to your other iCloud connected devices.

The resolution calculator helps you to calculate a resolution by filling in the other side, according to your set ratio. Editing the set ratio is as simple as a tap, too. When choosing your scale, you can either put in a standard fraction like 16:9, or put in a resolution you want to scale up or down while keeping the same aspect.

And when you've got a resolution you want to save, just tap Add Preset to save it with a custom name. You can edit your presets at any time.

Resolutioner supports iPhone, iPad, and Mac. All of your saved presets sync over iCloud, too.",2021-05-11T07:00:00Z,2021-05-12T04:27:49Z
