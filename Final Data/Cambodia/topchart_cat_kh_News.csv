Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to discussing topics. Some of the most popular global communities are:
■ r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions
■ r/funny, which is full of humorous content, jokes, hilarious memes
■ r/science, for scientific talks and daily news from the scientific community
■ r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your fun  and viewing pleasure
■ r/music, r/fredagain, r/beyonce and other music forums where music fans gather to discuss their favourite artists and genres.

On Reddit you’ll find:
■ Thousands of community groups and interesting topics, and a wealth of original content.

■ AMAs, or ""Ask Me Anything""

Reddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humour and insights for top conversations about anything; science discoveries, pop culture, gardening, entertainment, or financial advice.

Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career advice, fitness plans, and more.

Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.

Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social media network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps maintain content quality and community standards.



Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.
