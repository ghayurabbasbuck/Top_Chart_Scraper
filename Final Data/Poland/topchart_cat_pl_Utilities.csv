NordVPN is an easy-to-use VPN app for an iPhone or iPad, trusted by millions of users worldwide. It shields your online activities from nosy advertisers, cybercriminals, and intrusive internet service providers. How? By stopping trackers and encrypting your traffic to make it unreadable to anyone trying to take a peek at your browsing. 

Why NordVPN?

TURBO SPEEDS

We do everything we can to give you VPN connection speeds that are hard to beat. That includes creating custom protocols so you can have super-fast connections without sacrificing security.

GET HELP 24/7

Whatever it is — app issues, VPN connection problems, or payment options — we’ll sort it. Browse the Support Center, write an email, or visit our website for a live chat with customer support. 

POWERFUL ONLINE SECURITY

NordVPN secures your iPhone data with next-generation encryption algorithms. It would take millions of years to decrypt — so you know the information you send and receive is safe.

THOUSANDS OF VPN SERVERS

Your iPhone is probably not your only device that needs VPN protection. Use NordVPN to secure your laptop, tablet, and smart TV, or share your account with your family.

Features our users love:

• Strong VPN encryption for top-grade security.
• Unlimited VPN data for internet freedom.
• VPN protocols to choose from: NordLynx based on WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2/IPsec (for manual connections).

We'll save you the time: Yes, there are other apps that can help you quickly delete photos on your phone. But none of them worked for us!

We wanted a simple, fun, elegant solution that let us go month-by-month, work our way through all our photos, videos, screenshots, and everything else in our camera roll, and decide - one by one - what to keep and what to get rid of. That’s Swipewipe.

Here’s how it works: swipe right to keep a photo, and left to delete it. If you make a mistake or change your mind, just tap the current photo to go back. Hold down on a picture to see its metadata. After you’re done reviewing that month’s photos, take one last look at the photos you chose to keep and the ones you chose to delete, make any tweaks you need to, and then…you’re done!

Each time you finish a month, it'll be crossed out. (You can always revisit that month, though.) If you get part way through a month and want to take a break, you can quit the app - a progress wheel will appear next to that month on the main screen, showing you how much further you have to go.

If you’d rather not go month by month (or even if you do!) we think you’ll like our new On This Day feature. It sticks to the top of your Swipewipe home screen, and each day, it updates with the photos that you took on this date one year ago, two years ago, and so on. Revisit your memories on their anniversary, and swipe through to determine what you’d like to keep and what you’d like to delete. (It’s pretty fun.)

We also have:
- Bookmarks (for any pictures you want to set aside)
- A widget (and streaks!) for On This Day
- Stats that show you how many photos you’ve reviewed, how much memory you’ve saved, and more

…and we’re always adding cool new stuff!

Our camera rolls shouldn't be such a mess. You should be able to look back at the memories you've made without getting interrupted by blurry duplicates, irrelevant screenshots, and other clutter that keeps you from the good stuff. That’s why we’re making Swipewipe.

Hope you like it, and happy swiping!

(Oh, and if you have any feedback, ideas, complaints, life advice, or anything else — email us at hey@swipewipe.app!)

Every family's relationship with technology is unique, so we have built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings and more.


With Family Link, you can:

Establish digital ground rules
• Set screen time limits – find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so that you can help your child find a healthy balance.
• Manage your child's apps – give your child the flexibility that they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.

Manage content filters and security and privacy
• Manage what they see online – set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites and more.
• Secure their account – Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child's password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel that it's necessary.*

*Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.

Stay connected on the go
• See where they are – it's helpful to be able to find your family when they're on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they're carrying their device.
• Get notifications and alerts – Family Link delivers critical notifications, including when your child arrives at or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device's remaining battery life.


Important information

• Family Link's tools vary depending on your child's device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps that you have previously approved or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will only apply when your child makes a purchase through Google Play's billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternative billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child's installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
• You should carefully review the apps on your child's supervised device and disable those that you don't want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
• To see the location of your child or teenager's device, the device must be turned on, recently active and connected to the Internet through data or Wi-Fi.
• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google Accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child's online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the Internet safe. Family Link cannot determine the content on the Internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device and determine what path to online safety looks best for their family.",2018-05-29T23:26:13Z,2025-11-20T00:20:39Z
