The most efficient and proven method is with flashcards. By using Fiszkoteka flashcards you can quickly build up your vocabulary and language skills. They by far outperform traditional language courses that are often dull and lead to disappointing results.

We have created this app because we want to share an awesome product that we are certain will help you achieve many if not all of your language ambitions. Everyone using our app will be able to find value in our products. No matter if you are a language aficionado, preparing for a proficiency exam or practicing for an upcoming trip abroad. We have prepared everything to aid your language learning quest! 

It is intimidating and overwhelming to think about conquering a whole new language, but that is where we come in to give you a hand. Our app is user friendly and has been tailored for all language learners, regardless if you are a beginner, advanced learner, or somewhere in between. 

If you are thinking about taking a language proficiency exam, our flashcards will help you feel confident and ready to tackle popular exams such as DELF, DAAD, DELE and the CPE. Fortunately, grammar in general is quite simple. Knowing the basics is sufficient enough and it is not worth spending more of your time learning it, as all of this will come naturally.

With our app you can learn numerous languages online with multiple courses created by professionals. In addition, there are a plethora of language lessons created by other users, many of whom are native speakers.

Our app is a free product which can be downloaded and used right away. You have the options to sample all of our courses and languages that we have to offer. You can even create your own flashcards for free! 

The flashcards have been compiled into many forms, such as pronunciation in MP3 format, images, examples of relevant phrases used in natural contexts, as well as some basic grammar information.

Learning languages has never been easier and more exciting! 

Our other features include using our app as a translator. Just type a word in your native language or language you are learning. Apart from the translation, you will be able to add this (with the pronunciation and exemplar usage) to your own flashcards.

In this way, you cannot only check meanings of words but also learn and memorize them forever (as if it were there all along). Our methods will remarkably broaden your vocabulary and in the future you will no longer need to bother with any form of dictionary! 

Our app also helps you achieve a systematic approach to learning. Motivation and discipline is key to learning any language successfully and we are here to help you stay on track. We are passionate about languages and it may seem that we harp on the study and learning aspect a bit too much, but this app is also meant to be entertainmenting and of course fun. We have especially designed our app to make it feel as if you are not learning, even though you actually are. 


One great and easy habit to get into is setting reminders for yourself, which you can set as a widget for studying languages after unlocking your mobile screen.

We are leaps ahead of our competition because our methods actually churn out positive results. What separates us from the competition is that we have figured out a systematic learning approach that learners will appreciate and use as their main method to continue learning. We created an app that actively engages the language learner rather than having them passively translate sentences or try to understand obscure and impractical sentences. Words and phrases will not only be familiar or ring a bell, but they will stay locked in your memory for good. 

With Fiszkoteka, you now have the power of language at your disposal to wield and create sentences with an impressive level of fluency.",2014-02-25T22:22:53Z,2025-03-27T13:32:31Z

• “Platforma eTutor oferuje ogromną ilość narzędzi do nauki języka, gier językowych, ćwiczeń czy też forum Społeczność, ale najważniejszą według mnie funkcjonalnością, z której korzystam praktycznie na co dzień jest powiązanie ze słownikiem Diki i możliwość dodania nowo znalezionych słów i wyrażeń do powtórek.” - Rafał Dercz

• “Super aplikacja. Już po przerobieniu poziomu A2 można przełamać barierę językową. Szkoda czasu na darmowe aplikacje. Jak się kupi w promocji wychodzi 15 zł/miesiąc. Nie zamieniłbym na żadną inną.” - Andrzej D.
