Zoom Earth is an interactive weather map of the world and a real-time tracker of storms and hurricanes.

Explore the current weather and see forecasts for your location through interactive weather maps of rain, wind, temperature, pressure, and more.

With Zoom Earth, you can track the development of storms, hurricanes, and severe weather, monitor wildfires and smoke, and stay aware of the latest conditions by viewing satellite imagery updated in near real‑time.



SATELLITE IMAGERY

Zoom Earth shows weather maps with near real-time satellite imagery. Images are updated every 10 minutes, with a delay between 20 and 40 minutes.

Live satellite images are updated every 10 minutes from NOAA GOES and JMA Himawari geostationary satellites. EUMETSAT Meteosat images are updated every 15 minutes.

HD satellite images are updated twice a day from NASA polar-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra.



RAIN RADAR & NOWCAST

Stay ahead of the storm with our weather radar map, which shows rain and snow detected by ground-based Doppler radar in real-time, and provides an instant short-term weather forecast with radar nowcasting.



WEATHER FORECAST MAPS

Explore beautiful, interactive visualisations of the weather with our stunning global forecast maps. Our maps are continually updated with the latest weather forecast model data from DWD ICON and NOAA/NCEP/NWS GFS. Weather forecast maps include:
