Create any widget you can imagine to perfectly match your style. Get all the info you need, exactly how you want it, without the clutter.

• Easy Widget Creation •

You don’t need to be a pro designer. Just know what you want, and let your creativity flow. Add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and place it where you want. Repeat until your widget is perfect, then assign it to a slot and drop it on your home screen. Voila!

The Widgy editor is super simple with just two parts: the preview and the layer list. Edit a layer to tweak its appearance and data. The live preview shows exactly how your widget will look, so no more back-and-forth.

• Everything You Need •

Widgy has all the elements and data sources you could ever need, from system info to weather. Display your data as text, charts, or whatever you like.

• No Limits •

Forget templates. With Widgy, everything is 100% customizable. It’s your widget, your way. The only limit is your imagination.

• Easy Sharing & Discovering •

Share your creations with friends or the entire Widgy community in just a few taps. Use a URL, QR code, JSON data, or a file. You can even publish it in the Explore section for everyone to see.

Need inspiration? Check out thousands of widgets in the Explore section, or join the Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities to see what others have created.


NOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.

As with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.

Out of the what seems like millions of apps I’ve downloaded in efforts to make an “aesthetic” Home Screen they have all had some glitch in them that makes it nearly impossible to even load one widget onto the screen, and when you finally do it’s not even the right picture, but this app is PHENOMENAL it’s so simple and self explanatory to use.

it’s AMAZING
it doesn’t cost money and you can just watch the ads instead to pay. It’s so much easier to edit your home screen with so many ideas. I wish they could add widgets that come with it. I told all my friends to get it it’s soooo good. Overall it’s the best app i’ve found so far to make your home screen aesthetic.
