على سبيل المثال، إذا كنتم بسوق تجاري ممتاز، وتواجدتم بالقرب من شخص يستعمل تطبيق ""وقايتنا""، فإن هاتفيكما المحمولة ستتبادل رموز تعريف مشفرة ومجهولة، هذه الرموز يتم تخزينها محليا على مستوى هاتفك المحمول. ولا يتم تبادل أي معطى شخصي يمكن استعماله من أجلتحديد هويتكم أو مكان تواجدكم.

في الحالة التي تتأكد فيها إصابة مستعمل لهذا التطبيق بفيروس كورونا المستجد المسبب لمرض ""كوفيد-19""، فإنه السلطات الصحية تطلب منه إرسال لائحة رموز التعريف المخزنة محليا على مستوى هاتفه المحمول إلى خادم معلوماتي مركزي، وذلك باستعمال واجهة التطبيق ""إعادة نقل المعطيات"". وهذا سيمكن من تحديد الأشخاص الذين كانوا متواجدين بالقرب من الشخص المصاب، وذلك عبر رسالة نصية قصيرة، وبالتالي من التكفل السريع بهم من أجل تفادي المضاعفات المحتملة المرتبطة بالمرض والحد من العدوى.

يتم استعمال التطبيق حصريا على مستوى التراب المغربي من أجل التصدي لانتشار جائحة فيروس كورونا المستجد ""كوفيد-19""، على أن يتم سحبها من تطبيق "" Apple Store "" بعد الإعلان عن نهاية الجائحة.
