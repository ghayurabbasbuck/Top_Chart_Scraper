With a single tap, erase people and distractions for a clean scene, then swap to white/transparent, office, home, café, city, rooftop or beach-sunset backgrounds. Create professional headshots with LinkedIn Shots; experiment with realistic hair changes (curtain/wispy fringe, bob, pixie, bun, long or wavy, added volume & shine, and colour shifts – blonde, brown, red, black, light/dark, subtle highlights). Add make-up your way (winged liner, cat eye, long lashes, blush & contour, matte or glossy, festival looks) and refine skin (smooth, brighten, glow, freckles, tan, matte, under-eye bags). Tune face details (dimples, cheekbones, jawline, cupid’s bow), choose natural smiles (classic, wide, pretty teeth, closed), and add glasses without glare (thin/thick, oval/rectangle, sunglasses). Finish with Photoshoot modes (Model, B&W, Spotlight, Cinematic, Old Money, Beach Sunset) or get creative with cartoon, Pixar-style, clay, sketch, 90s anime or caricature – all fast, photoreal and ready to share.
