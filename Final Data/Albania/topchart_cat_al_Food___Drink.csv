Zest integrates a mind-blowing cooking education into your routine. Learn to cook with us through step-by-step explanations of foundational cooking concepts in fewer than 10 minutes and dishes that bring the concept to life. Our recipes are created by two former Michelin star chefs, distilled by a home chef, and cooked by you, the superstar home cook that you are (or will be). We don't assume any prior culinary knowledge. We meet you where you are and help you improve.
 
Stop copying traditional recipes - start learning from Zest. We've cooked those delicious Bon Appetit dinners. But when we took away the recipes we felt like lost puppies. Zest is designed to teach you the how's and why's of cooking. So when the recipe is gone you can confidently navigate the kitchen. The promise: Taste improvement after one dinner with Zest.

FEATURES:

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
We've all tried cooking a TikTok recipe. You rewatch the video 13 times to figure out what the hell is going on. Zest embeds videos throughout recipes so you can click into content when you need it. No more pausing and restarting. Learn at your own pace.
 
CONCEPT VIDEOS
Watch a short video on a new concept at your own pace and then cook recipes that reinforce what you've learned. We dive into topics like the science of tasting and the basics of seasoning, sautéing, roasting and more!

SKILL VIDEOS
Don't know how to dice an onion? Don't be embarrassed, we got you covered. Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).

CURATED MENU
Choose a menu to fit your preferences. Tired of wasting produce? Search for dishes including what’s already in your fridge. Got allergies? Compile safe recipes in your menu to find them when you’re ready to get cooking. 

GROCERY LIST
Shop your menu with our automated grocery list. Plus, utilize our helpful tips while you shop. Don't know what a neutral oil is? We got you covered.

PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Rate the recipes you cook, so we can recommend similar ones.

Feedback? Technical Issues? Killer ideas you want to contribute to make our app better? Email us at support@zestapp.co. We're always here to help and would love to chef up new ideas together!

Whatever you want, whenever you want it, it’s just a few taps away!

• Coffee & food
You haven't cooked and you're hungry. We’ve been there. You woke up, and there's no way you’re getting up without a coffee. We get it. You always study late at night, but a chocolate-banana-cookie crepe could take your productivity to the next level. We totally understand. So, how can we help?
 - Quick order: Through “Order again”, easily find and repeat your previous orders.
 - Special selections: With Chef Leonidas Koutsopoulos, we created the Red Selection – a curated list of restaurants offering something special. We suggest taking a look. Or two. 

• Supermarket
Why go to the supermarket, when the supermarket can come to you? Forget the heavy bags, the checkout lines, and wandering through endless aisles.

Tap on the relevant category on efood and check out efood market — efood’s very own supermarket. Discover your favorite supermarket chains (SKLAVENITIS, AB, My market, Kritikos, BAZAAR, Carrefour and more) and choose whatever you want, at the same prices as in-store.

 - You choose the delivery time: Place your order and pick the day and time that works best for you. Yep, there are supermarkets open on efood, daily, even on Sundays.

 - Don’t miss the deals: Take a look at our awesome prices.

If you think that we would stop at food, coffee, and supermarkets, think again - we have more! Discover flower shops, liquor stores, pharmacies, greengrocers, butcher shops, fish shops, delicatessens, bookstores, technology products, bio products, optical stores, fitness options, and pet shops. What else do you want? We can bring that too!

 - Forgot a birthday or anniversary? No worries - order flowers, books, or anything else you’d like, and surprise your loved ones with a gift!
