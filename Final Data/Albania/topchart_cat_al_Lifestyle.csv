This app turns those techniques into easy daily routines that fit into real life.

On the home screen, you will see your icon, nickname, and a clear progress indicator. From here you can access breathing practices, daily tasks, your profile, app info, and settings. A statistics window lets you review your activity and see how consistent you have been.

The breathing section includes four guided methods:
• Abdominal breathing, proven to lower nervous system activity, helps reduce anxiety and return the body to a resting state.
• Rhythmic breathing balances internal pace, with short pauses after inhale and exhale that signal the body to slow down.
• Expansive breathing creates a sense of lightness by filling the chest and abdomen before releasing tension with a longer exhale.
• Releasing breath uses short inhales and extended exhales to quickly reduce irritation and emotional overload.

Each technique comes with step-by-step instructions, timing counts, and suggestions on when to use it whether before sleep, during moments of distraction, or in times of stress.

Daily tasks keep practice consistent without being repetitive. You may be asked to spend five minutes with abdominal breathing in the morning, try rhythmic cycles during a break, or combine expansive breathing with gentle stretches. At the end of the month, you can complete a “breathing session” that blends all four methods in sequence.

Your profile tracks either time or repetitions, depending on your preference. You can upload a photo, edit your nickname, and view personal analytics. Notifications, sound, and vibration can be adjusted in settings. An information section provides context on mental health and why breathing techniques are an evidence-based way to restore balance.

This is not just about exercises it is about creating a toolkit you can return to whenever you need clarity, calm, or energy. Each short session adds up, helping you build a reliable rhythm of stability throughout your day.",2025-09-26T07:00:00Z,2025-10-01T06:05:50Z

- Control from Afar
Quickly and easily connect and control all your devices from a single tap, no matter where you are! Organize your devices across Homes and Rooms with ease. Group your devices for batch control. You can also share devices to your friends or family members to control together.

- Know what’s going on
Get the status of your devices in real time. Understand what’s going on at home at a glance, and get instant notifications.
Intelligent features in the Tapo home security cameras let you tune into the action live, record important moments, talk to your pets, and scare away intruders.
*Get up to 30 days of cloud video history and enjoy AI detections with Tapo Care (subscription service) for Tapo home security cameras.

- Automate your home with Smart Actions
Make your Tapo devices work around your daily routine. Have your lights gently wake you up in the morning or turn off all your home devices when you leave home. Custom Smart Actions give your home that level of intelligence in a snap.

- Hands-free Voice Control
Use your voice to control your Tapo devices via Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri or your favorite smart assistant. Simple voice commands let you turn on/off devices, or adjust the brightness/temperature/color. You can even cast your security cameras to display on your TV – without opening the app.

Stay tuned for updates as we add new features and products to the Tapo family!
