HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Thousands of travel videos saved across your Instagram and TikTok… and zero time to turn them into a plan? You can’t search those folders, you keep rewatching clips to find the exact spot, pinning places on Google Maps takes forever, and spreadsheets don’t tell you how far anything is. We get it. Trip planning from scratch is painful—and your saved folder is begging to be used.

Roamy fixes the mess. With one tap, pull every location mentioned in a video, drop them onto a map, and see your entire collection of spots—clearly, visually, and all in one place. When you’re ready to go, just tell Roamy how many days you have. We’ll build a sensible, day-by-day itinerary that connects the dots for you. Trip planning, minus the stress.

Who Roamy is for
- You’ve got dozens of folders and thousands of saved travel posts across Instagram and TikTok.
- You love picking the spots—but hate the logistics.
- You want everything in one place: your saved locations, a clean map, and a plan that actually fits your days.

How it works

- 1-tap save from socials: Import places from TikTok/Instagram with a single click. Roamy detects locations mentioned in the video and adds them for you.
- See everything on a map: No more scattered folders or notes. Your saved spots appear on a clean map so you can visualize your trip at a glance.
- Your master collection: Keep every restaurant, landmark, café, and hidden gem in one organized list—with links back to the original posts and reviews.
- Get your perfect itinerary: Tell Roamy your trip length and we’ll arrange your days into a logical route so you’re not zig-zagging across town.
- Duplicate & share trips: Copy community guides or friends’ itineraries and customize them to your style—or share your own with a link.
- Review & go: Tap any spot for details, tips, and prep notes so you know exactly why it’s on your list.

Why people love it
- Turns chaos into clarity: Your social saves become a visual, actionable plan.
- Saves hours: Stop rewatching videos and manually pinning.
- Keeps your taste: It’s your collection—Roamy just organizes it and makes it trip-ready.
- Stress-free planning: From “I saved it” to “I’m going” in a few taps
