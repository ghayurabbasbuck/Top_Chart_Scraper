It is used to order a ride if you need to get from one location to a specific destination around a city or countryside. When developing the app, the attention was on the Africa passenger transport market. The result is an E-Taxi app that offers flexible and affordable rates for every passenger. The app works according to give-and-take offers between transporter and passenger, not according to arranged kilometre rates.



The E-Taxi app is very simple, fast and easy to use. For example, the user has 4 destination options, you can set your own favourite destinations or search for popular destinations in your area. E-Taxi has focus on the movement of people in Africa, so the user can choose between a ""shared taxi"" or a ""private taxi"". You can plan your journey alone or with friends and simply let the driver know in the app.



You can track your journeys in the history and set your favourites from there at any time. Safety takes priority, journeys are tracked from location to destination, every transporter is known to us and our system keeps verified record of each driver including picture, name, address, driver licence and ID. All vehicles in the E-Taxi fleet are physically inspected for fitness.



If you loose your items in the vehicle that transported you using the app, we will be happy to provide you with contact details of that vehicle and its live location with the navigation system.



Enjoy your daily journeys with E-Taxi and get transported safely to your destination. You will always find the best price for your journey with E-Taxi.",2025-06-24T07:00:00Z,2025-11-14T01:30:30Z

These are Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX, and they look like a ""train"" of moving lights since 60 satellites are launched together at a time.

Find out when you can see this phenomenon at your location!

Key features include:

*Speedometer module*
The color digital speedometer accurately displays the real-time speed and the real-time power of your mobile phone. With this module, you can also keep track of your maximum speed and average speed during your trip.

*Compass module*
This module helps guide your direction and provides altitude, track latitude, and longitude information, making it easy to analyze your current location.

*Live map module*
This module calls up the latest system map and accurately locates the user's current location, drawing the current track line.

*History module*
Detailed trip tracks are recorded in this module, with each entry viewable and editable. The track line can also be redrawn on the map. The data collected here also supports iCloud cloud synchronization.

*Setting module*
In the settings section, you can personalize the app language, color theme, speedometer display, track point recording rules, and more.

Explore even more unique and useful functions with the Speedometer GPS And Compass app!

For some devices without GPS module, you can ignore the speed in the settings to record the trajectory.
In situations where devices lack a GPS module or where GPS functionality is unreliable, users may have the option to ignore speed settings when recording trajectories. This means that the device will record the path taken without factoring in speed data. This can be useful in scenarios where the primary concern is tracking the route or path followed rather than the speed at which the user or device is traveling.",2023-03-09T08:00:00Z,2025-07-28T22:57:18Z
