It's easy – enter your child’s name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading stories about your son or daughter.

To make things even better, we've added beautiful soundtracks and detailed illustrations to accompany each story and help you raise your child in a positive environment. You can also make your own audiobooks! Take a few minutes to record yourself and your child will be able to listen to a charming audiobook in your voice!

If you like fairy tales, bedtime stories, or children’s books, then “Little Stories” is a great option for you! Let love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time!

Why “Little Stories”?
• 3500+ illustrations
• Illustrations will match your child’s gender
• 70+ exciting stories, and many more to come
• Enchanting music accompanying each story
• Create audiobooks by recording your voice!

We’d like to tell you a bit more about the process we use to create stories for your kids so that you have a better idea of the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.

1) We search for an author. Regardless of the writer’s nationality or language, we look for unique and captivating stories. Our main condition is that each bedtime story contains at most 50 scenes and is educational.

2) We create the storyboard. It consists of rough sketches that serve as the template for the finalized drawings in the storybook, helping us decide how it will look.

3) Once the storyboard has been approved by our team, we search for an illustrator. We take great pride in matching each artist with a story that suits their style. Personal touches make our bedtime stories for kids come to life!

4) At the same time, our composer begins creating the soundtrack for the story. Inspired by the theme of the tale, he designs a gentle melody that will transport your child to relaxation and sleep (maybe you too).

5) After the story is finished, we translate it so that the children of the world can enjoy it in their language.

6) The story is then published in our library of books for kids.

The entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. We take great care to provide an amazing experience.

We are always adding new children's stories to our collection! 
Stories are suited for kids aged 3+.
