The Azerbaijani Quran is not just about the words; it’s about connecting deeply with the teachings of Islam in a language that resonates with the heart. Whether you're a new learner or someone looking to strengthen your faith, the Azerbaijani Quran helps you understand and reflect on the messages of peace, love, and guidance that Islam offers. It's a bridge to a more personal, meaningful relationship with the Quran while still preserving the depth and beauty of the original Arabic text.

Before the Azerbaijani Quran translation, the Quran was primarily recited and taught in Arabic. However, for many Azerbaijani people, understanding the Quran’s meaning was a challenge due to the language barrier. This was the main reason behind producing translations of the Quran and other Islamic texts in Azerbaijani.

Приложение «Номерограм» позволяет найти историю продаж и отдельные фото машины в Интернете по гос номеру. Пробить по гос номеру авто у нас можно бесплатно.

Установите «Номерограм». Введите в поиск гос номер, и мы найдём вам историю продажи машины или отдельные её фото из Интернета. Покажем даты размещения объявления, цену и пробег.

В нашей базе свыше 25 000 000 номеров. Фотографии в «Номерограм» приходят как от людей (можно добавить фото машины с гос номером через приложение), так и с досок объявлений, социальных сетей и других сайтов. Всё из открытых источников.

«Номерограм» найдёт для вас по гос номеру:

Пробег автомобиля.

Если автомобиль ранее размещался на авито, автору, дром и т.д., мы найдём его фотографии и покажем пробег, который указал продавец в объявлении. Наша база непрерывно пополняется. 

Цена машины.

Также мы сможем показать вам цену машины. А если она продавалась несколько раз, то вы сможете увидеть историю изменения цены. Это полезная информация, которая поможет вам поторговаться.

Город продажи.

Мы можем находить не только пробеги и цены, но и города продажи автомобиля. Всегда интересно узнать, где бегала машина ранее. 

Фото ДТП и ремонтов.

«Номерограм» мониторит не только доски объявлений, но и другие ресурсы. Поиск по номеру может помочь вам увидеть фото ДТП или процесс ремонта автомобиля.

Ещё вы можете по фото выяснить, что машина бегала в такси.

Несколько показательных примеров:

Скрутил 100 000 километров пробега — А 774 СО 716
Жёсткое ДТП, машину восстановили — А 714 НТ 38
Была в ДТП и работала в такси — Т 146 УС 56
Бесславный конец японской гонки — О 461 ЕА 125

Мы хотим сделать мир лучше и помочь покупателям подержанных машин. Всё-таки приятно подстраховать себя перед покупкой авто, а не играть в лотерею. Для этого «Номерограм» и сделан.
