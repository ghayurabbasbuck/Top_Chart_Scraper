Whether you are at home in the gym or outside, Gravls training algorithm will provide you with a personalized workout designed to help you reach your fitness goals.

A new generation of fitness algorithm

Unlike existing fitness apps, Gravls Algorithm doesn't just assemble random workouts. Our technology looks at your unique attributes (gender, weight, age, training level) and studies your workout patterns to evolve around your schedule, goals, equipment, and place of training.

As you train more Gravl gets better. Your training plan will maximize your progress by adjusting intensity, volume, and weight for each session. The outcome is a balanced effective workout every time.

Optimal exercises

Not all exercises are created equal and Gravl knows this. We believe that mastering the most effective exercises is more important than having different exercises every time. We balance optimal movements and variation so that your exercises are diverse and challenging. 

For beginners, or seasoned gym-goers looking for new workouts, we have over 300 trainer-led videos so you can always add new movements with confidence.

Track your progress

Gravls Strength Score makes measuring your strength and progress straightforward. We calculate this based on 8 different subscores and millions of data points across people of your same age gender body weight and fitness experience.

Customization

You can let Gravl lead the way 100% or set up your own custom workout settings. You have the power to change your fitness goal, workout variety level, muscle split, duration, equipment, and more!
