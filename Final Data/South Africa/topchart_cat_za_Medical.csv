Number 1 in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and elsewhere! ***

This is the simplest-to-use contraction timer. The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.
If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us.",2014-07-20T03:35:07Z,2025-06-22T09:11:31Z

USING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR
Alarms can only be issued on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader or your phone (not both). To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.

Remember that the app and reader do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your sensor every eight hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data. You can upload and view data from all of your devices on LibreView.com.

APP INFORMATION
FreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a sensor.

[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system, as the app does not provide one.  

[2] Alarms that you receive do not include your glucose reading, so you must scan your sensor to check your glucose.
