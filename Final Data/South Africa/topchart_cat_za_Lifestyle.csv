za,South Africa,Lifestyle,6012,6,595287172,Hinge Dating App: Match & Date,"Hinge, Inc.",https://apps.apple.com/za/app/hinge-dating-app-match-date/id595287172?uo=4,0.0,4.53823,17381,Lifestyle,"HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED
Hinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.

HOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE
When it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:

* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.

* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.

* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.

* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.

* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.

The app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.

With Circles, you can create a group of people who share their locations within the group, so you can easily track their location history and current location. Invite members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number, and once they accept the invitation, you can locate them on the map at any time.

The app also includes geofence zones, which allow you to know when any of your circle members enter or leave a certain area by creating a location-based boundary. You can drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geofence at a specific location, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and get push notifications when someone enters or exits it. This feature can help you ensure that your loved ones are safe by automatically letting you know their whereabouts, without any effort from them.

In case of emergencies, the app includes an SOS function that sends an urgent push notification to all members of your circle when you tap on the SOS button, along with a live update of your location. This feature ensures that your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they need help or are in danger.

Other features of the app include the ability to view the location history of each circle member, find a lost device using the GPS phone tracker, and manage group circles and geofence zones.

Phone Tracker is your reliable GPS-based family locator and personal tracking app, designed to help keep your loved ones safe. It is not intended for spying or secret surveillance, and it cannot be installed remotely or without consent. To use the service, the user must install the app manually and approve the location-sharing request. By subscribing you can enjoy unlimited alerts, real-time tracking, extended location history and many more features!
