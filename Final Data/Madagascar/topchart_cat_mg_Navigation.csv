How it is working:

• User A wants to know a User B location.

• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.

• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.

• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.

Limitations:

• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.

• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).

• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.

The user location is determined in three ways:

• E.123, E.164
• RIR
• W3C Geolocation API
