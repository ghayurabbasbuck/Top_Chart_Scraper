We help not only bring your ideas to life, but also want to inspire you to new ones. We've prepared a lot of suggestions and tools for you to create without writer's blocks.
Our another important goal is to help you with finishing your drafts. We know it's not always easy or convenient to finish what you started, but we always encourage you to finish your project using quick access to tools and AI hints.

With our App it is now possible and accessible to everyone without exception. Notes understanding and musical education are not necessary!

◆ WRITE DOWN YOUR LYRICS
All notes and musical ideas are now in one place so you don’t lose anything.

◆ CHORDS LIBRARY
Choose chords from a large library or from the most frequently used ones - they're arranged in such a way as to quickly select the ones suitable for each other. You can also see recommendations for chords that might work for you. Listen to a chord by tapping on it. 
You can find different finger placement options and possibility to add chords to Favorites.
Also you can generate chord progressions in a given key and specify the major/minor for chords.

*** In order to add a chord to the text, you need to hold down the title of the chord (in a large square with frames at the edges) and drag it into the field above the text.

◆ AI RHYME GENERATOR
A smart generator of rhymes and synonyms will help you easily compose texts and find inspiration. Type in the word you want and the app will offer suggestions for you.

◆ CHORDS SUGGESTER
When you drag a chord into the lyrics, the app will suggest which chords go well with each other.

◆ CHORD PROGRESSIONS
You can choose chords in any genre and for any mood - we've prepared the huge library so that you can find the chord progressions to your taste.

◆ SONG TAGS
Now you can tag the desired part of the song (e.g. chorus, verse, solo, etc.). This feature will help you build a visual structure of the song. There are ready-made tags for these purposes, but you can also create your own.

◆ RECORD AUDIO
Record musical ideas and demo tracks directly in the app - the lyrics will always be before your eyes. No more switching between different apps and screens.
You can record as many tracks and takes as you want, and it will always be stored in your project.

◆ TUNE MUSIC INSTRUMENTS
A simple and accurate chromatic tuner will help you set up your musical instrument correctly, since any song starts with that. We think that it's essential part for song writing :)

◆ CIRCLE OF FIFTH
We have an updated Circle of Fifth with the improved chord selection algorithms. Here you can choose the desired sounding from various musical modes (for example, Lydian, Ionian, etc.).

◆ TEXT AUTO-SCROLLING
Set the convenient scroll speed for your text and sing without interruptions. In the settings you can choose one of two modes: with chords playback and highlighted text, and standard scrolling.

◆ FILES EXPORT
You can export the project to an audio file: either an archive with all tracks in m4a format, or each track separately. You can also download a finished PDF file for printing.

◆ MANAGE & SEARCH SONGS
Now you can distribute your songs into folders, select your own covers, quickly search and sort your songs.

◆ COLOR SETTING
Change the color scheme of the app for yourself.
