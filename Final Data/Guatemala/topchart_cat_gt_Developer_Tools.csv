Why Haptics Feedback?
Haptics are an essential part of any modern app, enhancing user engagement by adding physical responses to actions like taps, swipes, or alerts. With Haptics Feedback, you can easily experiment with different types of haptic responses, see how they feel in real time, and get the code snippets you need to implement them in your own projects.

Key Features:
1. Comprehensive Haptic Testing:
Test the full range of haptic feedback types on iOS and watchOS devices, including:

2. Advanced Haptics Visualizer:
For developers who want to dive deeper into the haptics design process, the Advanced View offers a powerful visual representation of the haptic feedback.

3. Apple Watch Haptics Testing:
Designing an Apple Watch app or extension? Haptics Feedback offers a seamless way to test and adjust haptics directly on your Apple Watch.

Get hands-on with real-time feedback on your wrist.
Not wearing your watch? No problem! Use the built-in Apple Watch Haptics Simulator right on your iPhone to see how haptics would perform on the watch.

4. Developer-Focused Design:
Haptics Feedback is tailored specifically for developers, providing not only the tools to test and visualize haptics, but also the code snippets needed to implement them. Each feature has been designed to simplify the process of adding haptics to your apps, reducing guesswork and saving you time.

Who Is This App For?
 - App Developers: Enhance the user experience in your apps by integrating perfect haptics that match every action.
 - Game Developers: Craft immersive and tactile game experiences that pull players deeper into your game world.
 - UX/UI Designers: Experiment with haptics to bring your interface designs to life and create memorable interactions.
 - Tech Enthusiasts: Discover how haptic feedback works, experiment with different styles, and learn how to bring a professional touch to app interactions.

Why Haptics Matter
Imagine pressing a button in your app and feeling a subtle vibration that confirms your action, or getting an alert on your Apple Watch that not only makes a sound but gives you a tap on your wrist. These sensations create a more intuitive, engaging, and satisfying user experience. With Haptics Feedback, you can test these scenarios and make sure they feel just right before adding them to your app.",2024-10-10T07:00:00Z,2025-09-23T00:02:27Z

You can transfer files using scp and curl, edit them with vim and ed, process them using grep, awk and sed. Work with git repositories using lg2. 
Most commands are compiled for iOS native Arm64 format, making them fast and well integrated with iOS underlying BSD Unix.

a-Shell mini includes Python, Lua, JavaScript and webAssembly for programming and scripting. It also includes native ffmpeg and convert for fast image and video conversion.

There are also multiple network utilities: nslookup, ping, whois, ifconfig... Type help for help, help -l to get the full list of commands. 

a-Shell mini can be controlled from Shortcuts: run commands in order, process files in a-Shell, get the results as text or files, transfer files to other apps...

a-Shell mini uses iPadOS 13+ “multiple windows” ability, so you can run multiple shells at the same time, with different commands, in different directories. You can edit a file in one window with vim and process it in the other with python. 

a-Shell mini is a minimalist terminal, designed to have a very small footprint (less than 250 MB). If you need more commands, please consider a-Shell, which has more Python packages, more JavaScript modules, Perl, make, a C and C++ compiler and TeX.",2020-12-09T08:00:00Z,2025-11-22T21:42:27Z
