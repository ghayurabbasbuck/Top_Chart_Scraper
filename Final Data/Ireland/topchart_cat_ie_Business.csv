To verify your identity online, you need to:
1.	Have a basic MyGovID account
2.	Be 16 years of age or older
3.	Have a valid Irish passport
4.	Have proof of your address on the island of Ireland

If you do not have a basic MyGovID account, you can get one by going to www.mygovid.ie and completing the following steps:
1.	Click ‘Create an Account Now’ in the top right corner of the page
2.	Enter your personal details
3.	Enter the one-time passcode that was sent to your email address
4.	Agree to the terms and conditions.

With a basic MyGovID account, you can verify your identity by downloading the MyGovID App and logging in using the details of your basic MyGovID account. You will be guided through the following steps:

Step 1: Identity Document
You need to confirm your identity by taking a selfie, taking a photo of your passport and scanning your passport with your phone. These steps match your selfie with your passport photo to help confirm your identity.

Step 2: Additional Details
You need to provide your birth surname, your mother’s birth surname, confirm your address, and provide proof of your address on the island of Ireland. Proof of your address must be a recent document that shows your name and address such as a utility bill, insurance policy, or other official document. The document must be dated within the past 6 months.

Step 3: Account Security
In order to keep your verified MyGovID account secure, you will be asked to select two  security questions and enter your mobile phone number. Each time you log in to your MyGovID account, you will receive a one-time passcode to the mobile phone number you provide.

Your submitted online application will be reviewed and you will receive an email in approximately 10 working days. If approved, you will be able to access a range of online Irish government services using your new verified MyGovID account and you will receive your Public Services Card, by post, to the address you provided.



If your application is not successful, you will need to attend your local Intreo Centre to complete your application.

Your personal information will not be stored in the application or on your mobile phone once you complete your application. Only the minimum personal information required to access online Irish government services is provided. For more information, visit www.MyGovID.ie.",2024-07-04T07:00:00Z,2025-06-25T00:51:38Z

Review from eCommerce News HQ
“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“

Review from David B via g2.com
“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”
