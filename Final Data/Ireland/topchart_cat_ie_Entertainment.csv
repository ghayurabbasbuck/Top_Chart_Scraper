We’ve been there: Every game night starts with googling rules, grabbing pens and paper, or trying random apps. But there’s just no really good party app. So we decided to build one.

Our goal? Bring the best and most viral party games together in one place. For example: Who’s the Impostor? - you’ve probably seen it on TikTok or Insta.

Easy to learn. Quick to play. Perfect for 3 to 12 people.

Great for house parties, birthdays, or your next night with friends. Gather your crew - and have fun.

The app is free to enjoy with your friends! For some extra features, Splash Plus gives you full access with a weekly subscription. You can check out our Terms, EULA, and Privacy Policy here: https://cranberry.app/terms.

Help your children explore video content that they love and that parents trust, in an app made just for children. With easy navigation tools and a suite of features, you can help your children spend time online uncovering new interests, unleashing their imagination and building their confidence in their own unique world.

Help your children grow at their own pace
Your children are unique, so they should only see content that they're ready to explore. Decide what videos will help them make the most of their time online, then personalise individual profiles using custom content filters as they grow.

– Help your youngest children learn their ABCs, nurture their curiosity and more in 'Preschool' mode.
– Expand your children's interests to songs, cartoons or DIY crafts in 'Younger' mode.
– Give your older children the freedom to search popular music and gaming videos in 'Older' mode.
– Or, hand-pick the videos, channels and collections that your children can see in 'Approved content only' mode.

Rewatch videos and bond over favourites
Quickly find your children's favourite videos and the content that you've shared with them in the 'Watch it again' tab.

Shape your children's viewing experience with parental controls
Parental control features help you limit what your children watch, and better guide their viewing experience. Our blocking process aims to help keep videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and safe – but each family's preferences are unique. Don't like a video or channel, or see inappropriate content? Flag it for our team to review.

Set a screen-time limit
Encourage your children to take a break in between exploring content. Use the 'Timer' feature to freeze the app when screen time is up so that your children can apply their new skills to the real world.
