• Super Sub
We’ve all been there. Watching the match, the centre forwards are in blistering goalscoring form and you’ve chucked them in a bet – then they dislocate an eyelash in the first few minutes and hobble off. That’s the end of that. Not anymore. If your player selection is hauled off, your bet will switch over to whoever replaces them, and thus the Super Sub was born!

• Multi Match Bet Builder
Combine your Bet Builder across multiple matches!

• Popular Bet Builder
Not sure who to back in your bet builder? Follow the crowd with Paddy’s new Most Popular Bet Builders feature. This feature lets you see what bet builders other people are backing in real-time.

• Player Stats
