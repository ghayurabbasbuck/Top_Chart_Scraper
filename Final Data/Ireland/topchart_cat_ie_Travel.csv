HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.
