*From the team at ORIGINATOR - the creators of the beloved Endless Alphabet and Sesame Street's Monster at the End of This Book and Another Monster....  Originator is a team of passionate artists and engineers dedicated to the best education+entertainment apps for kids.*

As a follow-up to Endless Alphabet, set the stage for early reading success with Endless Reader!  This app introduces ""sight words"", the most commonly used words in school, library, and children's books.  Kids need to recognize these words by sight in order to achieve reading fluency.  Recognizing sight words is advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling, cannot be sounded out using phonics knowledge, and often cannot be represented using pictures. 

Kids will have a blast learning sight words and their context and usage with the adorable Endless monsters.  Each word features an interactive word puzzle with letters that come alive, and then a sentence puzzle with words that become what they describe.  See the word ""dog"" as a barking dog, and the word ""up"" reach for the sky!

** NOTE: You must be online and have sufficient disk space while running the app to get all words in the app. **

Features:
- 6 words free to try with additional word packs available for purchase.
- Delightful animations reinforce sight recognition of words in a fun and interactive way.
- Word puzzles reinforce spelling using lower-case letters and the sentence puzzles teach definition and usage (in addition to sight recognition).
- 3D Touch on iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus makes letters and words react in an extra special way!
- Endless Reader was designed with your children in mind.  There are no high scores, failures, limits or stress.  Your children can interact with the app at their own pace.",2020-04-10T07:00:00Z,2022-08-11T20:02:07Z

Stop Scrolling Social Media -> Download Deepstash -> Use it for 5 min/day -> Become the smartest in the room.

Join 3 Million+ smart people to discover new ideas, learn new things, improve yourself and inspire others.

Knowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.

Ideas are created by users just like you. Whenever you read a book, article or listen to a podcast and find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, you can add an idea about it in Deepstash. You see the source of the idea right in your feed.

What to do with ideas? They are fundamental to your wellbeing, success in life or your career. Ideas can make you:
- Smarter (you'll know more stuff, doh!)
- More Creative (you can connect more dots)
- Happier (better habits, less anxiety)

Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.

PERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS

Choose a few topics of interest and directions (like increasing productivity, building better habits or earning more money) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.

The more you read and save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.

BUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

You can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.

Search and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes.

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Add your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.

Share your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this.
