In the Maldives, the current process of connecting blood donors with recipients is marred by inefficiencies and privacy concerns. Typically, recipients resort to posting urgent blood requests on messaging platforms, relying on chance for potential donors to see their messages. This approach is not only time-consuming but also unpredictable, leaving those in need in a state of uncertainty.

Compounding the issue, a plethora of donor names and phone numbers circulate within the community, and recipients are tasked with individually reaching out to each potential donor. This not only wastes valuable time but also compromises the privacy of donors who may find their personal information widely disseminated.

Ley App addresses these challenges head-on, offering a streamlined and secure alternative. By enabling recipients to make blood requests directly within the app, Ley App automatically notifies eligible donors, eliminating the need for recipients to rely on chance or navigate extensive lists. Moreover, Ley App prioritises donor privacy by providing a secure platform to share their contact information only with the recipient, sparing them from the discomfort of having personal information openly shared.

Say goodbye to the cumbersome process of individually calling numerous donors or navigating through a maze of personal phone numbers. Ley App not only simplifies the connection between donors and recipients but also ensures a respectful and efficient exchange. Download Ley App now to be part of a transformative solution that values time, privacy, and the urgent needs of those seeking blood donations in the Maldives.

Connecting recipients directly with donors, our app ensures a seamless process where those in need can effortlessly request blood, and eligible donors are promptly notified.

Within the app, donors can easily offer to donate, and recipients receive instant notifications when potential donors express interest. Contact information is shared, allowing recipients to directly connect with donors via calls or texts to coordinate the donation process. Additionally, donors can keep track of their donation history, with the app providing timely reminders for eligibility.

Fostering a sense of community, Ley App features a dedicated section where coworkers, family members, or friends can form groups to track each other's donation eligibility. This community-centric approach ensures a support system in times of urgent need, allowing users to see who within their community can donate.

To further empower users, Ley App includes a comprehensive FAQ section providing valuable information about blood donation. By dispelling myths and offering insights, the app aims to encourage more people in the Maldives to participate in this life-saving act.

Join us on Ley App as we redefine blood donation, making it a more connected and informed process in the beautiful Maldives. Download now and be part of a community that saves lives.",2024-10-30T07:00:00Z,2025-04-13T21:14:43Z

Not too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.
- Track your pregnancy journey. Get weekly insights on pregnancy symptoms, learn how to read ultrasound scans, monitor contractions, and keep track of your baby’s movements with a kick counter.

For best results:

- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.
- Use the app in a quiet room
- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)
- Put the phone in Airplane Mode
- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press ""Record"" to create a recording
- Use AirPods
