ClapFind is your smart and simple way to locate your phone and prevent theft — all with the power of sound. Whether it’s buried under the couch, hidden in your bag, or silently stolen from your pocket, ClapFind helps you stay in control.

Key Features:
- Clap to Find: Clap your hands and your phone will ring, flash, or vibrate — even if it’s in silent mode. No more lost-and-found panic at home or in the office.
- Voice Passcode: Set your own voice command (e.g., """"Hey Phone!"""") and speak it aloud when your phone is misplaced. Perfect for moments when your hands are full.
- Don’t Touch Mode (Anti-Theft Alarm): Place your phone on a surface — if anyone moves it, a loud alarm will go off. Great for café tables, work desks, or public spaces.
- Pocket Mode (Pickpocket Alert): Place your phone in your pocket. If someone tries to pull it out without your knowledge, the app will trigger a powerful alarm with optional flashlight strobe.
- Fully Customizable Alerts: Choose from multiple alarm sounds (including funny, loud, or scary tones), flashing light styles, and vibration patterns. Tailor everything to your style and needs.
- Simple Setup, Fast Activation: No tech skills required. Just tap to turn on the feature you need — it runs quietly in the background, ready to react.

Keep your phone safe. Find it fast. With just a sound.
