Do you really know what ingredients your favorite foundation contains? The OnSkin app will set your mind at ease by telling you precisely what you’re putting on your skin and whether it's safe for you.

COSMETIC SAFETY SCANNER
With OnSkin, you have a seasoned digital cosmetologist by your side. Choose from three ways to get a product’s safety profile—take a photo of it, scan its barcode, or look up its name on the app. OnSkin will see past the glitz and glamor and decipher the Latin names on the label in a clear way, flagging any potentially harmful components. Plus, the app recommends cleaner alternatives to help you look and feel healthier inside and out.

SCIENCE IS OUR INFLUENCER
The OnSkin product ratings are 100% unbiased—we don’t partner with any brands. Our in-house team of biologists and physicians have used the latest scientific research on toxicology and dermatology to assess over 15,000 cosmetic ingredients. Using an AI calculating algorithm and human curation, we rate products promptly while preserving the quality of manual analysis.

PERSONALIZED SKINCARE TIPS
Just complete a short survey about your skin to get essential care steps and active ingredients to look for when hunting for new products, all tuned to your unique skin and curated by our skin experts. These may be a great kickoff for starting a substantial skincare routine or double-checking your existing one.

SKIN MATCH
Finding suitable products for your skin (especially if it’s acne-prone and sensitive) can be quite a puzzle, but with OnSkin, you’ll always know if a product is a perfect match, a potential match, or not a match for you. Based on the info you input about your skin type and skincare goals, we check how well a product is tailored to your skin needs, so you can invest in effective formulas without having to experiment with your face.

PRODUCT REVIEWS
Viral products seem tempting to give a shot, but how do you check whether it's all just hype before you rush to Sephora? Every week, you’ll see compilations of the top 10 most buzzy products from various categories, from washes to serums. For each, you’ll learn about the powerful and questionable ingredients and their effects, all explained in simple terms. Plus, our skin experts will weigh in on whether it's good value for money! You get to see the real face of raved-about skincare and pick items based on their effects, not just their popularity.

POPULAR SCANS
See what products are trending on the app and discover new faves!

GUESS THE SCORE
Test your cosmetic intuition with this quick, fun daily game. Is a product’s safety score above or below 50? Pick it right and get a chance to win Premium and scan products without limits!

AI SKIN HELPER 
Need specific advice on your skin type or want to learn more about that latest beauty trend? Type in your own query or choose from the most popular ones and get a professional consultation from the AI Skin Helper in a matter of seconds. 

HAIR LAB
With Hair Lab, you quickly get a cosmetologist-approved analysis of any hair product and see if its components are likely to suit your hair needs. Use Hair Lab to build your locks’ dream routine and enjoy having a good hair day every day!

Welcome to the Calorie Counter & Food Tracker app – your go-to tool for smarter eating and a healthier lifestyle.


With our revolutionary AI Food Scanner, you can now snap a photo of your meal and instantly get detailed nutritional information, making calorie tracking faster and more accurate than ever before. Say goodbye to searching for individual food items—just take a picture, and the app does the rest.


Weight management sounds simple: consume fewer calories than you burn to lose weight, and more to gain. But balancing these factors can be challenging. Our AI-powered food recognition technology takes the guesswork out of calorie tracking, so you can focus on your goals with ease. We created this app to be your supportive companion in reaching your weight management goals, making the process simpler and more efficient.


Our principle: It's always better to log calories and macros, even if it's not perfect, than not to log at all. Easier and faster logging reduces the temptation to skip it, and consistency is key to transforming your body.


Key features for sustainable weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance:


SMART AI FOOD RECOGNITION

Our new AI Food Scanner allows you to snap a photo of your meal and instantly get nutritional information. No more searching for individual food items—just take a picture, and the app does the rest. Whether spoken, typed, or photographed, logging is effortless.

PRECISE CALORIE & MACRO CALCULATOR

Take a quick quiz on your body and fitness level, and our app creates a personalized plan. Whether you want to lose fat, gain muscle, or maintain your weight, the app tailors a diet plan for you.


FLEXIBLE APPROACH

We follow the latest guidelines for sustainable fat loss or muscle gain, letting you choose a comfortable pace based on your goals and calorie budget.


MACRO TRACKER

We don't just track calories; we provide a personalized macro plan, starting with protein recommendations based on your activity level and body parameters. We also customize your carb and fat intake based on your preferred diet—whether balanced, low-carb, low-fat, or keto.


WATER TRACKER

Hydration is crucial. Our Water Tracker helps you monitor your daily water intake to ensure you're drinking enough throughout the day. Log your water and the app tracks your progress.


WEIGHT TRACKER

Our Weight Tracker helps you monitor weight changes over time. Track your weight regularly and see your progress with detailed insights. Whether you're losing weight, gaining muscle, or maintaining, this feature gives you a clear view of your progress.

Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.
- The subscription automatically renews. The renewal cost will be charged to your account 24 hours before the end of the current subscription, if auto-renewal has not been turned off.

FROM THE APP'S CREATOR 

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!


Growing up is not easy! But we support parents and children every day on this exciting journey.
