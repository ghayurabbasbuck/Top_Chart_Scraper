The features of the application have been developed with the needs of professional air shooting athletes in mind. In the near future the application will receive several updates to introduce new features, and it is for you to choose which exact features will be added!

Our features:

Training diaries
 - Create your personalized container which will store all the training results
 - Add your training discipline to the container by selecting discipline types from our pistol or rifle presets

Practical shooting

 - Choose features you want to monitor during your training, such as attentiveness, anxiety, self-control, drowsiness, etc.
 - For convenience, use the microphone on the keyboard to dictate what you think is important in your training, and save this recording in text form
 - Edit the already recorded data at any time convenient for you, for example, after training 

Data analysis
 - After entering the results of training sessions, you can review accuracy charts, where you can see the direct dependence of the result on your attributes
