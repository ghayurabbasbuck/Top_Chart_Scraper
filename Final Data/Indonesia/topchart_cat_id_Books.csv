It’s now easier to read the Quran on the go, memorize it and listen to your favorite reciters.

This is just the beginning for Quran for iOS. We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com

As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.

It’s the same as the Bible you’d find in English or other languages, but it's all translated into Bahasa Indonesia, so it's easier for people in Indonesia to understand and connect with the Bible scriptures.

There are various versions of the Alkitab Bible; a few translations stay close to the original language, whereas some translations of the Alkitab Bible are casual to be understood by the modern readers. 

The Alkitab Bible has been used by Indonesian Christians everywhere, whether in church, at home, or for personal study.
For many people, the Alkitab isn’t just a book it’s a source of comfort, strength, and hope. Whether in times of struggle or simply seeking guidance, it’s a trusted companion.

Famous stories from the Alkitab, like Noah’s Ark, David and Goliath, and Jesus’ miracles, are well-known beyond religious circles. These stories are often used to teach valuable lessons about life and morals, resonating with people in many different contexts.",2015-04-23T22:36:17Z,2025-05-22T07:39:25Z
