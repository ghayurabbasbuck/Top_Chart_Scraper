It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.

* Scientific Research *

The popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.

You can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.

* Full Version *

This is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:

- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.
- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.
- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.
- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.

* How to Use *

To generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:

- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).
- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).
- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).

The application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen.",2013-07-25T00:43:43Z,2021-05-12T01:09:43Z

Dyslexia is much more common than we might think. In fact, it affects more than 10% of the population. This disorder has an impact on learning—making reading and writing more difficult in general. Dyslexia can occur in children of any intelligence level, even those without any psychological, physical, or social problems. The difficulty they have in reading does not affect their other cognitive abilities. Furthermore, people living with Dyslexia often ""sharpen"" their senses more deeply and develop a high level of intelligence and creativity.

People living with Dyslexia can be affected by various alterations in their cognitive abilities. This app is used to investigate the following aspects related to this disorder: Focused Attention, Divided Attention, Visual Scanning, Short-Term Memory, Short-Term Visual Memory, Recognition, Working Memory, Planning, Processing Speed, and Response Time.

INVESTIGATIVE TOOL FOR EXPERTS IN NEUROSCIENCE

This application is designed to promote scientific research by providing digital tools which help in the cognitive evaluation and treatment of people living with this disorder. Dyslexia Cognitive Research is an instrument for the scientific community and universities around the world.
