It doesn’t produce sound - instead, it connects to FL Studio over WiFi to control it like a physical MIDI controller. Use pads, faders, knobs, and even create your own layouts to suit your workflow.


To get started, open FL Studio on your computer and launch FL Studio Remote on your iOS device. As long as both devices are connected to the same network, the connection is automatic - no setup required.

Once connected, you can:

* Control FL Studio instantly, including instruments and effect plugins, just like any other MIDI controller.
* Connect up to 15 devices at once, whether they’re Phones, Tablets, or Chromebooks.

FL Studio Remote includes a variety of built-in controller tabs such as:

* Transport controls
* MIDI keyboard
* FPC pads
* Harmonizer keyboard
* Performance Mode (Clip launcher)
* Gross Beat FX
* Mixer and more

If you need more customization, FL Studio Remote lets you create your own tabs using a wide range of control types:

* Pads, faders, knobs
* Jog wheels, X/Y pads, piano keyboards
* Harmonic grids, clip launchers, mixer strips, and containers

Each control is fully customizable, enabling you to design a virtual MIDI controller setup that perfectly suits your workflow.
