PipeCalc AI transforms how audiences find and enjoy movies and TV. Instead of static genre lists, our platform introduces Sage, a conversational AI that understands mood, context, and personal taste. Tell Sage about your perfect evening, current vibe, or favorite themes and receive recommendations that feel natural and uniquely tailored.

What Makes PipeCalc AI Different

Conversational Cinema Intelligence
Sage doesn’t just filter data—it chats with you, turning discovery into a human-like conversation and delivering suggestions that cross typical category lines.

Multi-Layer Discovery

Sage (AI Chat): Context-aware movie guide.

Voyager: Curated collections such as Cinema Magnetism for trending hits and Narrative Mastery for critic favorites.

Vault: Smart watchlist with cross-platform sync.

Nexus: Central hub for personal preferences.

Distinctive Design

Our Cinematic Glassmorphism interface pairs a rich dark theme with soft blue highlights to reduce eye strain. Proprietary gradients, spring-physics animations, and glass-effect overlays create depth and elegance, while professional SF-Symbol icons and a floating tab bar keep navigation clean and modern.

Intelligent Curation

PipeCalc AI’s algorithms highlight what matters now:

Today’s Pulse: Real-time trending analysis.

Weekly Obsessions: Predictive picks from social buzz.

Series Zeitgeist: Tracks shows shaping culture.

Context-aware genre filters for precise results.

Fair & Flexible Access

Our credit system makes premium AI free to explore: watch optional ads to earn credits—no mandatory subscription. This ethical model supports development while respecting user choice.

Platform-Neutral Recommendations

PipeCalc AI integrates with major streaming services and shows only content you can actually watch, eliminating the frustration of unavailable titles.

Built for Privacy & Performance

Developed in SwiftUI and powered by the OpenRouter API plus TMDB’s database, PipeCalc AI offers:

Local caching for smooth offline browsing.

End-to-end encryption of user preferences.

Zero personal data collection beyond anonymous metrics.

Why It Belongs on the App Store

PipeCalc AI is more than a TMDB wrapper:

Unique Interaction: Conversational AI that understands context, not just keywords.

Original Visual Style: A fully custom cinematic aesthetic.

Proprietary Curation: Exclusive naming and content groupings.

Ethical Monetization: Credit system keeps AI access inclusive.

Thoughtful Experience: From onboarding to daily use, every detail is designed for enjoyment.

Who It’s For

Cinephiles seeking deep discovery and hidden gems.

Casual Viewers wanting quick, mood-based picks.

Families needing age-appropriate suggestions.

International Users with multi-language support and regional awareness.

Roadmap for Innovation

Coming features include advanced mood detection, social watch parties, AR poster scanning, voice navigation, and collaborative watchlists.

Invite members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number, and once they accept the invitation, you can locate them on the map at any time.

This feature can help you ensure that your loved ones are safe by automatically letting you know their whereabouts, without any effort from them.

In case of emergencies, the app includes an SOS function that sends an urgent push notification to all members of your circle when you tap on the SOS button, along with a live update of your location. This feature ensures that your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they need help or are in danger.
