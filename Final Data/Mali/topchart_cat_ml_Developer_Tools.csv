ml,Mali,Developer Tools,6026,23,1668447062,Server: Host Files Locally,Dumpling Software UG,https://apps.apple.com/ml/app/server-host-files-locally/id1668447062?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Developer Tools,"Start a web server on your mobile device and access it from other devices in your local network.

FEATURES

- Use folders stored locally on your iPhone/iPad or in iCloud
- Serve static files and websites over HTTP
- Run the server also while the app is in the background
- Enable Directory Listing to browse the selected folder in your browser
- Multitask in SplitView on iPad by eg. using the server and Safari at the same time
- Add password to control access to shared content
- Customize Directory Listing: theme, dotfile visibility, footer text

HOW TO

1. Choose a folder and press “start”
2. Open the generated IP address in a browser on a device in the same WiFi network
3. Done, there is no third step!

USE CASES

- Quickly share files on your iPhone/iPad with other devices in the same WiFi network
- Host a static website, useful for eg. software developers working on the go
- Send files to devices that have limited connectivity features (eg. GPS navigation, gaming consoles etc)
- Create a small media server for your household

TIPS
- The server works on and is visible to other devices only on the same WiFi network (ie. connected to the same router)
- This is a static server which means can’t be used as eg. a PHP or NodeJS backend server
- The Background Mode requires an audio track played while the app is not visible. Go to settings to pick from a number of pleasant nature sounds!",2023-01-29T08:00:00Z,2023-02-13T03:21:11Z
