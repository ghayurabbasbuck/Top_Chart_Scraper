It lets you log tool life with fields like tool code, machine, material, cutting time, parts made, and wear condition so you can see when a cutter really needs to be changed. You can also keep a clean regrind history, noting each regrind number, date, shop, material removed, and current tool size to know how many good runs are left in a tool. Built-in converters help you switch between power, torque, and speed, and between coolant flow units like L/min and gal/min, plus bar and psi for pressure. The app also gives small calculators for engagement time per part, cycle time per part, and best step-over or step-down so you can tune your programs. With all tool and regrind data in one place, you can spot bad cutting conditions, catch root causes, and cut down on sudden tool breaks. CutterUsageTracker helps you use each cutter for the right time, lower tool costs, and keep your machines running more smoothly.",2025-11-19T08:00:00Z,2025-11-19T13:47:22Z
