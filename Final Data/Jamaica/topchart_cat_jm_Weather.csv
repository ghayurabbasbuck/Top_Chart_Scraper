Zoom Earth is an interactive weather map of the world and a real-time tracker of storms and hurricanes.

Explore the current weather and see forecasts for your location through interactive weather maps of rain, wind, temperature, pressure, and more.

With Zoom Earth, you can track the development of storms, hurricanes, and severe weather, monitor wildfires and smoke, and stay aware of the latest conditions by viewing satellite imagery updated in near real‑time.



SATELLITE IMAGERY

Zoom Earth shows weather maps with near real-time satellite imagery. Images are updated every 10 minutes, with a delay between 20 and 40 minutes.

Live satellite images are updated every 10 minutes from NOAA GOES and JMA Himawari geostationary satellites. EUMETSAT Meteosat images are updated every 15 minutes.

HD satellite images are updated twice a day from NASA polar-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra.



RAIN RADAR & NOWCAST

Stay ahead of the storm with our weather radar map, which shows rain and snow detected by ground-based Doppler radar in real-time, and provides an instant short-term weather forecast with radar nowcasting.



WEATHER FORECAST MAPS

Explore beautiful, interactive visualisations of the weather with our stunning global forecast maps. Our maps are continually updated with the latest weather forecast model data from DWD ICON and NOAA/NCEP/NWS GFS. Weather forecast maps include:

Precipitation Forecast - Rain, snow, and cloud cover, all in one map.

Wind Speed Forecast - Average speed and direction of surface winds.

Wind Gusts Forecast - Maximum speed of sudden bursts of wind.

Temperature Forecast - Air temperatures at 2 meters (6 feet) above the ground.

""Feels Like"" Temperature Forecast - Perceived temperatures, also known as apparent temperature or heat index.

Relative Humidity Forecast - How air moisture compares to temperature.

Dew Point Forecast - How dry or humid the air feels, and the point at which condensation occurs.

Atmospheric Pressure Forecast - The average atmospheric pressure at sea level. Low-pressure areas often bring cloudy and windy weather. High-pressure areas are associated with clear skies and lighter winds.



HURRICANE TRACKING

Follow hurricanes from development to category 5 in real-time with our best-in-class tropical tracking system. Information is clear and easy to understand. Our hurricane tracking weather maps are updated using the very latest data from NHC, JTWC, NRL, and IBTrACS.



WILDFIRE TRACKING

Monitor wildfires with our active fires and heat spots overlay, which shows points of very high temperature detected by satellite. Detections are updated daily with data from NASA FIRMS. Use in conjunction with our GeoColor satellite imagery to see the movement of wildfire smoke and monitor fire weather in near real-time.



CUSTOMISATION

Adjust temperature units, wind units, time zone, animation styles, and many more features with our comprehensive settings.

The app was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions.

With information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan.


▼　All the information you need, in one app

Get a wide range of disaster prevention information, including weather and typhoon forecasts, rain radar, earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption alerts, emergency weather warnings and landslide information, river information, and heavy rain risk notifications.

By interacting with the map on the screen, you can zoom in on your location or pan across the country and see the cloud cover, typhoon forecast areas, tsunami warning areas, or the scale and intensity of an earthquake.


①　Providing users with the most appropriate disaster information

The home screen displays the information you need at the time and place you need it. When there’s an earthquake, the home screen will show you the latest information. If another type of warning or alert is issued while the earthquake is active, the app will sort them depending on the type, elapsed time and urgency, so you’ll always have the most important information at your fingertips.


②　Push Notifications for Important Information

We send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes.

Note: Critical Alerts will only be sent to users in the target area of the most urgent types of disasters. Users who have registered their location but are not in the target area will instead receive a normal notification.

※ In order to receive Critical Alerts, you need to set your location permissions to “Always Allow” and have Background App Refresh turned on. If you don’t want Critical Alerts, you can disable them from Settings.


③　Barrier-Free Design

We paid close attention when designing the app to ensure our information is accessible to everyone. We put a focus on accessibility, with colour schemes that are easy to distinguish for people with colour blindness, and use a font with large, clear letters so long bodies of text are easy to read.


▼　Supporters’ Club (In-App Purchase)

In order to keep doing what we do, we’re looking for supporters to help us cover the development and operational costs of the app. The Supporters’ Club is a voluntary membership scheme for those who want to give back to the NERV Disaster Prevention app, by contributing to its development with a monthly fee.

You can find out more information about the Supporters’ Club on our website.
