Sounds good, right? Never again will you have to wonder who‘s on the other end of the line – Call ID -  Call Blocker will take care of all your unwanted and unknown calls and messages. Simply enjoy your life without distractions.

Call ID -  Call Blocker is an amazing tool that will help you:

IDENTIFY CALLER-ID INSTANTLY
Call Blocker immediately tells you whether the person calling you is one of your contacts or possibly a blacklisted number from the database. The app offers you Caller ID lookup, showing your business information instead of only the usual location. You can choose which action to take and get rid of phone spammers forever!

BLOCK ALL UNWANTED CALLERS
Block all those unwanted numbers - robocalls, auto calls, telemarketers, and other scam callers. Be the one who decides which calls and messages are worth your attention.

CHOOSE BLOCK OR IDENTIFY FOR EVERY CATEGORY
The app shows you caller ID or blocks calls automatically based on your preferences. You can choose a different setting for each category for the database - so block spam, scam, and telemarketing calls but let the app identify trustworthy numbers or unknown callers.

PROTECT YOUR INCOMING MESSAGES
From now on, you can filter your incoming text messages with keywords. The app will detect the entered keyword in your texts and filter it into a junk folder.

USE THE UP-TO-DATE DATABASE
The app compares all your calls with the numbers in our database. The database is updated regularly to ensure your privacy and security. We deal with unwanted numbers so you don’t have to.

ADD NUMBERS TO THE DATABASE
Add numbers of unwanted callers to a user-shared database. We’ve got your privacy covered and will never share any of your contacts with the list.

CREATE YOUR OWN BLACKLIST
Decide what to do with unwanted callers. Do you want to block them from ever calling you? Or do you want to leave them access but be warned when their number comes up? Or do you want to deal with each number individually? It's all up to your decision.

REVERSE LOOKUP AND SEARCH NUMBERS
You can also compare any missed calls from unknown numbers with the database list and find out the identity of the caller easily.

BACK UP YOUR BLACKLIST
Back up your blacklist and access it easily by signing into your account and sharing it across all your devices.

Every family's relationship with technology is unique, so we have built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings and more.


With Family Link, you can:

Establish digital ground rules
• Set screen time limits – find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so that you can help your child find a healthy balance.
• Manage your child's apps – give your child the flexibility that they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.

Manage content filters and security and privacy
• Manage what they see online – set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites and more.
• Secure their account – Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child's password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel that it's necessary.*

*Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.

Stay connected on the go
• See where they are – it's helpful to be able to find your family when they're on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they're carrying their device.
• Get notifications and alerts – Family Link delivers critical notifications, including when your child arrives at or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device's remaining battery life.


Important information

• Family Link's tools vary depending on your child's device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps that you have previously approved or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will only apply when your child makes a purchase through Google Play's billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternative billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child's installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
• You should carefully review the apps on your child's supervised device and disable those that you don't want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
• To see the location of your child or teenager's device, the device must be turned on, recently active and connected to the Internet through data or Wi-Fi.
• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google Accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child's online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the Internet safe. Family Link cannot determine the content on the Internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device and determine what path to online safety looks best for their family.",2018-09-23T16:36:46Z,2025-11-20T00:20:39Z
