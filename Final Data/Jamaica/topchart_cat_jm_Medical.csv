It seamlessly incorporates patient weight, disease processes, mixtures of local anesthetic, and presence or absence of additives, to calculate the maximum safe dose of local anesthetic without the hassle of going through the calculations by hand, all while tracking how much of the maximum safe dose has been used up and how much is left over for safe administration.

FEATURES:
●	Dosage calculator for local anesthetics, including complex mixtures and non-standard concentrations.
●	Adjusts maximum safe dose by patient weight (lbs or kg).
●	Choice between anesthesia with or without epinephrine.
●	Option to add comorbidities such as extremes of age, severe renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, or advanced heart failure, with automatic adjustment of maximum safe dose.
●	Ability to calculate remaining safe dose of anesthesia for anesthesiologist or surgeon to administer based on how much has already been administered.

Calculations based on Chapter 36 (Local Anesthesia) of Miller’s Anesthesia, 8th Edition. Adjustment for comorbidities based on the 2004 publication “Maximum Recommended Doses of Local Anesthetics: A Multifactorial Concept” by Rosenberg et al.

The information provided by the application is based on expert opinion. It is to be used as a recommendation only. Clinical judgment by a physician is required in every situation. The user assumes all responsibility for decisions made with the information provided by this app.

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.

Watch wonderful ultrasound videos of babies in different weeks of pregnancy. If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.

ScanBaby is divided into three different modes:

-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.

-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.

-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.
