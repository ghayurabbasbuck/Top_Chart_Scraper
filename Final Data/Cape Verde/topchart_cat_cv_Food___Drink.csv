What are you waiting for? Activate your location and we’ll activate your taste buds! You set the tone, we set the table.

TheFork continues to be savoured across the biggest foodie hotspots in France, Spain, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden. But wait, what exactly do we bring to the table? Here are 6 reasons to download TheFork app right now.

1. Things that tickle our taste buds: fast, free and easy online booking
We know that normal life means having a lot on your plate, so to make things a bit easier for you, we've simplified restaurant booking. With a few simple taps on our mobile app, you’ll be one step closer to having that ‘mmm’ moment of pure belly satisfaction, in the most seamless way possible.

2. Frugal on prices, never on flavours
Our amazing restaurant partners love their diners as much as we love ours and offer exclusive discounts on reservations throughout the year (automatically applied and subject to conditions at the time of booking). That way restaurants get to open their doors to all types of diners, making dining out accessible to everyone.

3. Community insights = better bites
Tuck into the wisdom of our gourmet community! With over 20 million trusted reviews from only customers who have actually tried the restaurant—your palette is in good hands!

4. We don’t skimp on choice
Reserved? Not us. That’s just a label for a table.

5. We take loyalty VERY seriously
To reward our awesome foodie community, every booking with TheFork accumulates unique Yums points, which can be redeemed in the form of a tasty discount at one of our many partner restaurants down the line. Here’s how it works:

1 reservation = 100 Yums (Y)

Once you've accumulated enough you can enjoy amazing offers which converts to: 
1000 Yums = £20 loyalty discount!
2000 Yums = £50 loyalty discount!

Keep an eye out for Double Yums and other ways to earn more Yums as you book.

The interface looks like a cozy fridge, and each product is visualized as an item in a nest, with eggs taking center stage. It helps users track food items, monitor expiration dates, estimate the total value of their fridge, and manage a shopping list — all wrapped in a light-hearted, visually engaging experience.

The main screen displays your virtual fridge with organized shelves. You can add products manually, specifying name, category, quantity, purchase date, and expiration. Categories include dairy, vegetables, meat, eggs, and others — each placed on its own ""shelf."" Eggs are treated as a special product type, displayed in a dedicated egg tray. When an item expires, it’s marked with a distinct “rotten egg” icon for quick recognition. You can also view a filtered list of soon-to-expire or missing items.

EggRow Keeper includes a simple analysis tool. When adding items, you can enter their price (per unit, kilogram, liter, etc.). The app then calculates the total ""value"" of your fridge contents. A category breakdown shows where most of your spending goes (e.g., ""Dairy — 38%""). It also keeps track of patterns — how often you buy eggs, which items run out the fastest, and more.

The integrated shopping list helps with restocking. Items that are out of stock are suggested for the list automatically, but you can add or remove anything manually. Once an item is marked “purchased,” it can be moved directly into your fridge. You can also sort the list by category, making trips to the store more efficient.

A unique feature of the app is the “Egg of the Day” — a daily card offering a fun fact, quote, or practical food storage tip. The cards come in various humorous moods like “The Philosopher Egg” or “The Proud Egg.” You can save these cards to your gallery or share them with friends on social media.

Additional settings include expiration reminders, currency and unit preferences, data reset, and access to the privacy policy and developer info. EggRow Keeper offers a practical yet playful approach to home food organization — especially for egg lovers.",2025-08-12T07:00:00Z,2025-08-27T19:30:13Z

Zest integrates a mind-blowing cooking education into your routine. Learn to cook with us through step-by-step explanations of foundational cooking concepts in fewer than 10 minutes and dishes that bring the concept to life. Our recipes are created by two former Michelin star chefs, distilled by a home chef, and cooked by you, the superstar home cook that you are (or will be). We don't assume any prior culinary knowledge. We meet you where you are and help you improve.
 
Stop copying traditional recipes - start learning from Zest. We've cooked those delicious Bon Appetit dinners. But when we took away the recipes we felt like lost puppies. Zest is designed to teach you the how's and why's of cooking. So when the recipe is gone you can confidently navigate the kitchen. The promise: Taste improvement after one dinner with Zest.

FEATURES:

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
We've all tried cooking a TikTok recipe. You rewatch the video 13 times to figure out what the hell is going on. Zest embeds videos throughout recipes so you can click into content when you need it. No more pausing and restarting. Learn at your own pace.
 
CONCEPT VIDEOS
Watch a short video on a new concept at your own pace and then cook recipes that reinforce what you've learned. We dive into topics like the science of tasting and the basics of seasoning, sautéing, roasting and more!

SKILL VIDEOS
Don't know how to dice an onion? Don't be embarrassed, we got you covered. Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).

CURATED MENU
Choose a menu to fit your preferences. Tired of wasting produce? Search for dishes including what’s already in your fridge. Got allergies? Compile safe recipes in your menu to find them when you’re ready to get cooking. 

GROCERY LIST
Shop your menu with our automated grocery list. Plus, utilize our helpful tips while you shop. Don't know what a neutral oil is? We got you covered.

PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Rate the recipes you cook, so we can recommend similar ones.

Feedback? Technical Issues? Killer ideas you want to contribute to make our app better? Email us at support@zestapp.co. We're always here to help and would love to chef up new ideas together!
