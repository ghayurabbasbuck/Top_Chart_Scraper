With Circles, you can create a group of people who share their locations within the group, so you can easily track their location history and current location. Invite members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number, and once they accept the invitation, you can locate them on the map at any time.

The app also includes geofence zones, which allow you to know when any of your circle members enter or leave a certain area by creating a location-based boundary. You can drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geofence at a specific location, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and get push notifications when someone enters or exits it. This feature can help you ensure that your loved ones are safe by automatically letting you know their whereabouts, without any effort from them.

In case of emergencies, the app includes an SOS function that sends an urgent push notification to all members of your circle when you tap on the SOS button, along with a live update of your location. This feature ensures that your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they need help or are in danger.

Other features of the app include the ability to view the location history of each circle member, find a lost device using the GPS phone tracker, and manage group circles and geofence zones.

Phone Tracker is your reliable GPS-based family locator and personal tracking app, designed to help keep your loved ones safe. It is not intended for spying or secret surveillance, and it cannot be installed remotely or without consent. To use the service, the user must install the app manually and approve the location-sharing request.

Smart Circles
With Smart Circles, you can create a circle of people who all share their locations within the group and can track each others location history and location in real time. Invite group members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number. After the invitations are accepted, you can find people in your circle easily at any time.

Geo-fence zones
Use geozones to know which of your circle members are in a certain area the moment they arrive. Setting up is easy: first, drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geo-fence at a specific location. Next, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and once it's created, you'll know when your circle members enter and exit it by getting push notifications. Geo zones automatically let you know where your loved ones are without any effort from them — for example, you can create a geo-fence at your children's school to tell you they've arrived safely, or create one around your home to alert you when a family member is about to arrive.

Emergency SOS function
In trouble? By tapping on the SOS button, all members of your circles will get an urgent push notification that you need help, with a live update of where you are. You can feel secure in your life knowing your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they are lost, in danger, or need help.
