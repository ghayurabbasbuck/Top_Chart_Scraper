The YouDJ mixer comes preloaded with a collection of music, but you can also play MP3 files stored on your device.

It's important to understand that no DJ app, including YouDJ, can integrate with Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music due to their closed platforms and the DRM encryption on their songs. Also, legally mixing popular music without paying on mobile platforms doesn't exist unfortunately.

The YouDJ Mixer is available on all desktop and mobile platforms, so you can rock the party wherever you go. But we highly recommend you to try the computer version too (you.dj).

-When it comes to DJing, mixing is everything.
-It’s easy to mix 2 songs together naturally as if they were 1.
-First, use Beat Sync to match the tempo and beat, then you're ready to move the faders to blend the tracks together.


Make DJ sound effects, even if you’ve never done it before
-Don't worry if you don't know much about DJing.
-You can use the sampler to create DJ sounds.
-Try hitting the pad and tap Horn.
-Then tap it to the rhythm of the song.


Touch and scratch the sound
-Try touching the sound displayed in white, yellow, and blue waves.
-Move your finger backward and forward to scratch the track.


Slow down the music without changing the pitch of the notes
-If you have a song that’s so fast you can’t understand the vocals, you can change the tempo and play it back slower, but without changing the pitch of the notes.
-This is great not only for DJs, but also for changing the speed of backing tracks when practicing with musical instruments or dancing.
