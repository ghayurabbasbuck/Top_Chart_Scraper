Instead of measuring directly from your device, the app provides indoor comfort estimates — giving you an idea of how your environment might feel inside, whether it’s fresh, cozy, or a bit off balance. At the same time, you can compare these details with live outdoor conditions, side by side, in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Stay in control with smart alerts: set your preferred comfort range and get notified whenever conditions go beyond it.

Weather isn’t just data here — it comes alive with creative stickers and moods. A sunny day may greet you with bright smiles, a rainy afternoon with dramatic vibes, and a hot afternoon with playful notes like Sunburn Incoming or Need Coffee. It’s a lighthearted way to connect with the sky outside.

To add a touch of personality, the app also shares thoughtful weather quotes every day. Sometimes inspiring, sometimes humorous — always in tune with the moment.

This isn’t just a weather app. It’s your comfort guide, weather moodboard, and a small reminder that the climate around you can shape the way you feel.
