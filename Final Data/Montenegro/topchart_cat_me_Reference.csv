Our advanced technology generates a stunning photo of your ancestors and reveals your true origin story. See who you really are. All from just one selfie.

Forget boring family trees that end in names on a chart. We offer a tangible connection. Our technology renders a lifelike, era-authentic portrait of ancestors you’ve never met, capturing a plausible likeness with a strangely familiar face. It’s a jaw-dropping, shareable moment of connection when you see your own eyes, your smile, looking back at you from another time. This is the family photograph that was never taken.

But the portrait is just the beginning. It’s your entry point into a complete Ancestral Report, a deep dive into the elements that define your heritage.

First, discover your true origins with a detailed, percentage-based breakdown of your nationality. Go beyond continents to see the specific blend of cultures that make up your unique identity, revealing connections you never knew existed. Then, we reveal their story. Learn about the specific city your ancestors likely called home, the authentic craft they dedicated their lives to, and even the historical diet that fueled their world.

Your origin story doesn't just end in the past—it echoes in your present. The resilience of a frontiersman, the precision of an artisan, the creativity of a storyteller; these are more than historical facts, they are potential traits within you. We connect your heritage to your life today, offering unique insights for modern careers and lifestyles that may align with these ancestral strengths. It’s a powerful new way to understand your own passions and potential.

Join a growing community of people discovering themselves in a completely new way. The stories and portraits generated by EDNA are sparking conversations, connecting families, and helping people see their own identity in a richer, deeper light. It's a unique experience everyone is talking about.

This robust framework allows us to create a narrative that feels both magical and deeply plausible. We are committed to your privacy; your photo and personal data are always secure and are never shared.

Suitable for beginners.

What is Namaz?
Namaz is the daily muslim prayer, also known as Salat or Salah. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and the best way of worshipping Allah the Almighty.

Description:
This app is an audio player for you to listen to the correct pronunciation of the prayers in Arabic. It will help you to learn the dua-invocations and parts of the Quran that are read inside the prayer. You will also have the texts in English transliteration and some illustrations to help you navigate through the process. All content is in accordance with the rules of the Hanafi school of law.

Important to understand, that this is a companion app, and it is not sufficient to fully learn the prayer on its own. We also strongly recommend that you learn to read Arabic, as English letters and phonemes are not sufficient to convey all sounds found in Arabic. Learning to read Arabic will allow you to perform your prayers in the best way and will give you access to the Holy Quran. The easiest and most effective way to learn both prayer and reading Arabic is to find a good teacher.

me,Montenegro,Reference,6006,25,6748571304,SalahScreen: Prayer Focus,Rayane Sahi,https://apps.apple.com/me/app/salahscreen-prayer-focus/id6748571304?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Reference,"SalahScreen automatically blocks distracting apps when it's time to pray so you can show up for worship without the battle. No willpower needed. Just presence.

THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO WELL

You know you should pray on time. But your phone knows how to keep you scrolling. One notification becomes five minutes. Five minutes becomes a missed prayer. And even when you do pray, your mind is still half-tangled in what you just saw on your screen.

You're not weak. Your brain has been conditioned for constant stimulation. Prayer requires the opposite: stillness, focus, presence. SalahScreen bridges that gap.

HOW SALAHSCREEN WORKS

Auto-Schedules from Adhan
Prayer times trigger automatic blocking windows. Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha—your phone knows when it's time, so you don't have to remember.

Choose What Gets Blocked
Select by category (Social, Video, Games) or tap individual apps. Clear ""Blocked"" badges show what's paused during prayer.

Pray to Unblock
When prayer time ends, a gentle prompt asks if you have prayed. Resume intentionally, not impulsively. Need flexibility? Quick Pause gives you 5 minutes.

Post-Prayer Reflection
Close each prayer with a 30-second journal. Add quick tags, write a note, or just breathe. Turn ritual into remembrance.

Daily Ayah & Hadith
Arabic text with translation. Simple daily inspiration to keep you connected.

Build the Habit
Track streaks and consistency. No pressure. No guilt. Just clarity on your progress.

WHAT YOU'LL EXPERIENCE

- Instant relief – No more battling yourself at prayer time. The apps are just... gone.

- Improved focus within days – Your mind learns that prayer time means prayer, not multitasking.

- Sustainable routine in 3 weeks – Consistency without willpower. The habit builds itself.

- Spiritual transformation over months – Prayers that feel present. Connection that feels real.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS

""I used to feel so guilty missing prayers because I got lost scrolling. Now I don't even have to think about it. SalahScreen just handles it.""

""My screen time dropped 2+ hours per day. But more importantly, my khushoo improved. I actually feel present now.""

""Finally, a tool that understands Muslim rhythms. This isn't just another app blocker—it's built around salah.""

WHO THIS IS FOR

Students juggling classes and social media. Professionals drowning in notifications. Parents trying to model good habits. Anyone who's tired of feeling like their phone controls them instead of the other way around.

If you're struggling to pray on time, if your mind wanders during salah, if you're exhausted from the constant battle with your device—this is for you.
