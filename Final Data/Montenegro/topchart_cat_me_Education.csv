Dobro došli u Sofi Sovin čarobni svijet, gdje se zabava i učenje spajaju kroz igre, zagonetke i avanture! Uz pomoć simpatične Sofi Sove, vaši mališani će kroz interaktivne igre učiti pravilno izgovarati glasove, razbrajati, razvijati predčitalačke vještine i osnaživati logičko zaključivanje – sve što im je potrebno za uspješan početak školovanja.

Prva crnogorska logopedska mobilna igra za djecu uzrasta 3 do 9 godina nudi dva fascinantna svijeta: Sofiland i Logoland. U Sofilandu, djeca se pripremaju za čitanje i pisanje kroz zabavne igre koje jačaju njihove matematičke i jezičke vještine. U Logolandu, vođena pričama djece koja su prevazišla poteškoće u govoru, vaši mališani će kroz razne govorne igre razvijati svoj vokabular i poboljšavati izgovor.

Igra je pažljivo razvijena uz podršku logopeda, psihologa i roditelja, i nudi bogato, edukativno iskustvo koje pomaže u razvoju govora, pažnje, pamćenja i koncentracije. Kroz govorne zagonetke i izazove, djeca će na zabavan način jačati svoje fonološke vještine koje su temelj za čitanje i pisanje.

Sofi Sova nije samo edukativna igra, već vrijedan alat za roditelje i terapeute, osmišljen kao podrška u procesu govorne terapije. Iako igrica može biti sjajan dodatak, ne zamjenjuje logopedsku terapiju, već je dopunjuje i čini zabavnijom.

Ova mobilna igrica nudi preko sat vremena besplatnog interaktivnog sadržaja, jer vjerujemo da je ulaganje u djecu – ulaganje u budućnost. Uz Sofi Sovu, osnažite svoje dijete za nove školske izazove i avanture!",2024-11-14T08:00:00Z,2024-11-14T16:30:45Z
