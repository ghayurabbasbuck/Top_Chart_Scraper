“We started YNAB January 1st with $37 saved and ended the year with $42,000. Plus we paid $14,000 cash for a new roof.”
-Kyle, YNAB user since 2020


If you’re like the average YNABer (just AVERAGE), you’ll save $600 in the first two months. And $6,000 in the first year. But you might experience something much more powerful than a growing bank account balance or paid off credit cards: 92% of YNABers report feeling less stressed since starting YNAB.


“YNAB has removed the stress of money from my life and in doing so has helped make me a better husband. It's like I got to remove a personal flaw I had never been able to fix.""
-Kyle, again. We didn’t even pay him to say this, but maybe we should.


Every dollar represents you—it’s the product of your energy. You work too hard for all that to go to waste. We’ll show you how to give every dollar a job, so your paychecks are working toward your priorities and values, your wants and needs, your work and your play. Your money is your life. Spend it well with YNAB.
