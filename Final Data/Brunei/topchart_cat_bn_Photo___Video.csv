Turn every moment into a memory straight out of the ’90s

Do you remember that warm rush you felt opening a paper envelope of freshly developed prints? The tiny scratches, the dreamy light leaks, the date stamp that proved you were there? 1998 Cam brings that feeling back in one tap – no waiting, no darkroom, just instant nostalgia every time you press the shutter.

Why people fall in love with 1998 Cam
Films, not filters – 100 + authentic film stocks with dust, grain and light‑leak overlays that look lived‑in, not layered on.

Shoot first, tweak later – real‑time preview while you’re framing the shot, plus a powerful editor to perfect the vibe after.

Retro video, too – give clips the soft flicker of home‑movie VHS or the warm fade of Super 8.

Zero watermarks – your story, your branding.

Delightfully simple – open, swipe, shoot, smile. That’s it.

What our UK community says
“It nails that disposable‑camera look without the faff.”
“My Insta grid finally feels cohesive and me.”
“I’m hooked – every photo feels like a memory already.”
