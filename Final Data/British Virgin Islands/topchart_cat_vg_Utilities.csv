VPN (virtual private network) technology creates an encrypted and secure ""tunnel"" between your device (like a computer, smartphone, or tablet) and a remote server, which may be in another part of the world. When you connect to a VPN, all data transmitted between your device and the server is protected by strong encryption. This means that even if someone tries to intercept this data, they won't be able to read it because of the encryption.

Your traffic passes through this encrypted tunnel, making you invisible to unauthorized observers, including your ISP and intruders. Your IP address, which is normally used to identify your device on the Internet, is replaced by the IP address of the server. This allows you to remain anonymous and will enable you to change your virtual location.

Note:
1. Please note that using VPN for illegal purposes is prohibited.
2. Unfortunately, the service does not work in China.
