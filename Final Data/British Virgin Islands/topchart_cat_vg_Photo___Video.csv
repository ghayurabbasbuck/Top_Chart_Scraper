All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... 

Our app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:

1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. 

 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!

- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! 

************************ 
WHAT CAN THE APP DO? 
************************ 

With this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:

• Nose reshaping
• Lips augmentation 
• Chin and face contouring 
• Weight loss 
• Muscle augmentation 
• anything you can reshape or shrink! 

For fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.


************************ 
HOW TO USE THE APP? 
************************ 

Using the app is very easy, even on small screens: 

• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. 

• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. 

• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. 

• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! 

• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! 

Download our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look.
