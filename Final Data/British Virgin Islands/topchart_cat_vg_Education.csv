trainchinese will teach you Chinese, with a free and complete dictionary, thousands of vocab lists, example sentences, audio recordings, measure words, character animations and Optical Character Recognition — not to mention a powerful flash card training system that even includes handwriting training!

• Our dictionary prioritises commonly-used words and phrases above the obscure and obsolete, while example sentences and measure words (classifiers) provide crucial context to help you decide which Chinese word is the most appropriate translation. Other dictionaries just leave you guessing!

• We've got Optical Character Recognition (OCR) too. Spotted some Chinese you can't read? Capture a photo of some Chinese text from a menu, book or sign, and the app identifies and translates the characters for you.  

• Search for words by part of speech

• Mistyped a word? Helpful spelling suggestions get you to the right results fast.

• Words feature both example sentences and measure words for nouns. It's time to move beyond ""个""! And best of all it's all connected: tap examples and measure words to open them as full dictionary entries.

• trainchinese is great for students: it includes more than a thousand vocabulary lists covering topics from International Relations to American Football Teams and more. Feel like something's missing? Users often get in touch to ask for lists on the topics they're studying, and we're happy to oblige! You'll also find lists containing HSK-level words (both old and new standards), plus TOCFL lists for students in Taiwan!

• Highlight words with your finger for super-fast access to character animations, related searches and more!

• Whether you're studying the Simplified (mainland China and Singapore) or Traditional (Hong Kong and Taiwan) variants, we've got you covered! Easily switch between them or choose to display both in dictionary results and on flash cards. Even better, you can use the phonetics you're comfortable with - choose from Pinyin with tone marks, Pinyin with tone numbers or even Zhuyin characters (from the BoPoMoFo system used in Taiwan).

• Create flash cards with audio and animation from dictionary entries. Organise them into lists, and share them with friends (or students).

• Our Spaced Repetition system ensures you'll memorize words for good.

• Train your way: each card is available in four different modes to test different aspects of Chinese study. See Chinese, Pinyin or English and get tested on translation, and even compare your handwriting to a stroke-order animation side-by-side, synchronized! Or if you prefer, there's multiple choice training too (for a real challenge, try it in ""Dictation"" mode!).

• Flash cards are saved on your device and synchronized with trainchinese.com, where you can also train with them and find more great content.

• Add study notes to your flash cards - they're saved and backed up at trainchinese.com.

Giggle Academy is a free AI-powered learning app with interactive games and activities that build literacy, numeracy, creativity, social-emotional skills, and more.

 Master Key Skills Through Play (No Boring Drills!)
We turn learning into joy with interactive games and activities that help users build the essential skills needed for school and life—no frustration, only giggles and growth:

- Solid literacy skills: From letter recognition and phonics to reading short stories and spelling simple words, our adaptive lessons adjust to the learner’s level. They can learn words independently, just like the early reading focus of Duolingo ABC—but we’ve added more creative storytelling to keep them engaged.
- Fun math fundamentals: Counting, addition, subtraction, and logic games turn numbers into play. Unlike some apps that rush learners, we let them practice until they feel confident—similar to the skill-building focus of Khan Academy Kids, but with shorter, more interactive activities designed for limited attention spans.
- Creativity that shines: Drawing, music, and storytelling tools let learners express themselves freely—encouraging creative exploration and providing more opportunities for independent creation.
- Social-Emotional Growth: Games about sharing, empathy, and managing emotions help users develop emotional intelligence—an often-overlooked skill that even popular apps like Lingokids emphasize, and we’ve made it more relatable to young learners’ experiences.

Independent Learning That Grows With the User
What makes us unique? Our adaptive learning technology—it observes the user’s learning and play process and adjusts the difficulty based on their ability. If the user easily completes a phonics game, they’ll move on to the next level; if they encounter difficulties, we provide gentle practice. This means:

- No more frustration from games that are too hard (or too easy!).
- Users can solve problems independently—building confidence that goes beyond the app.
- You’ll see progress quickly: Within weeks, they’ll be recognizing letters, counting to 50,achieving more giggle points,stickers and rewards by playing games、finishing challenges and flashcard learning，even sharing with their friends.

Parent-Approved, User-Loved (No Hidden Costs!)
Giggle Academy knows parents hate ads and subscriptions—so our app is 100% free, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no hidden fees. Unlike some apps that require a paid upgrade to access key features, we give you everything upfront:

- AI Driven: AI Reading, Voice Cloning & Real-Time Heuristic Conversations with MAX — covering stories, lessons, and chosen topics.
- Progress Tracking: Clearly see which skills the learner is mastering (literacy, math, social-emotional) and where more practice is needed.
- Content Safety: No external links, no pop-ups, and all content is designed by education experts—allowing learners to study independently and safely, just like with trusted apps such as ABC Kids or Lingokids.
- Perfect Anytime, Anywhere: Use it at home, on the go, or even as a quiet activity during playdates. Designed for ages 2–8—preschoolers and early elementary learners (kindergarten to grade 2) will enjoy the colorful, easy-to-use interface.

Why Choose Us
- The AI features that makes learning interactive and giggles.
- Adaptive learning helps learners grow independently.
- The skill mastery that prepares them for school (literacy, math, creativity, social-emotional).
- Offline access allows learners to study anytime, anywhere, even without an internet connection.

There are so many kanji that it is quite tough to remember them all or to keep studying them.
