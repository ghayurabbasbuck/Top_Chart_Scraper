Designed by seismologists, LastQuake is the official app of the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC). Thanks to the participative action of its users, only a few minutes are needed for the EMSC to estimate earthquake effects and notify the population.

[LastQuake is an ad-free app!]

** AN INNOVATIVE EARTHQUAKE DETECTION METHOD **

EMSC detects earthquakes using:

∘ Earthquake witnesses, who are the first to feel an earthquake, hence the first informed that an event is happening.

∘ Internet and mobile technologies, which allow rapid information collection of the effects observed by witnesses, who are asked to fill in a questionnaire and share photos and videos.

Want to learn more about our detection system? Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNCaHFxhZ5E

** COMMITMENT TO POPULATIONS AFFECTED BY EARTHQUAKES **

Information and communication are cornerstones in preventing risky behaviors. EMSC contributes to the reduction of seismic risk by providing you with:

∘ real-time information

∘ post-earthquake safety tips

∘ SMS service that allows victims to notify their loved ones.

** YOUR INVOLVEMENT MATTERS **

LastQuake is a citizen science project. Your contribution helps refine our understanding of earthquake effects while fostering our support in disaster preparation and response.

** KEY FEATURES **

∘ Real-time information and data

∘ Customizable notifications (destructive earthquakes, earthquakes near you)

∘ Access to comments, photos, and videos by eyewitnesses

∘ Information-sharing via social media

∘ SMS service to notify loved ones when in the area impacted by an earthquake

∘ Post-earthquake safety tips

** WHAT'S NEW ** 

∘ Interactive felt map

∘ Customizable notification test

∘ Earthquake notification through voice synthesizer 

∘ Copy-paste available for comments

∘ Minor bugs fixed

∘ New languages available: Croatian, Czech, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Hebrew

** WHAT IS EMSC? **

EMSC is an international non-profit scientific NGO founded in 1975. Based in France, EMSC federates data from the seismological observatories of 86 institutes from 57 countries. While operating a real-time earthquake information service, EMSC advocates for public participation in scientific research. Its core product, LastQuake, paves the way for innovative approaches to building more disaster-resilient communities, making EMSC among the pioneers of disaster apps dedicated to earthquakes and tsunamis.",2020-04-10T07:00:00Z,2025-06-11T15:06:26Z
