FAQs
***********************
- How do I talk to a doctor via Healee?
You can browse a list of doctors, with various specialties and expertise. Once you find the doctor you need, you can request an online consultation.

- How do doctor consultations work?
Once you connect with a doctor, you can describe your problem and ask for an online consultation. Ahead of the consultation, the doctor may ask you to provide additional info – your medical history, lab results, images. The doctor will respond with information about your condition, together with treatment advice.
If you cannot find the doctor you need, you can request an online consultation from a selected team of approved doctors. In this case, you send a description of your problem, and you get a response from one of the doctors, within 16 to 48 hours, depending on what delivery priority you choose.

- Can doctors prescribe medications through Healee?
Yes. If during the consultation, the doctor decides that you need a certain medicine, he or she can write you a prescription for that medicine. If you already have not done so when registering, you will be asked to provide your full name and age. Depending on your local regulations, this information is necessary for preparing a valid prescription.",2013-11-12T03:53:44Z,2025-11-11T20:46:11Z

If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.

Don't put yourself or your loved ones at risk by missing a dosage -- or taking a double dose because nobody tracked. Our mission is giving people the tools, support and information they need to take their medications the way they're supposed to.

Pharmacists rank Medisafe #1 out of 461 apps they've tested, and MyVCM has recognized Medisafe for HIPAA ""leadership and best practices in managing security and compliance.""

That's why millions have downloaded Medisafe, the top-rated medication manager and pill reminder for those who need reminders to take meds, fertility drugs, birth control, and other medicines.

Download Medisafe and start managing your medications, pills, refills, drug interactions, measurements and doctors' appointments to improve your health. Medisafe is the best pill tracker and planner on the App Store. Never forget to take your medications again! 

Also featured on Fox TV, ABC, Mashable, Inc. Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Life Hacker, Fast Company, TechCrunch, and many more.

Here's why Medisafe is the best:
CLEAN & SIMPLE: Visual and easy medical manager to handle drug reminders.
HEALTH APP INTEGRATION: Keeps track of your measurements and syncs them to the HealthKit app: blood glucose, blood pressure, weight, pulse and temperature.
REPORT SHARING: See your progress report and send it to the doctor or nurse as a visual informative PDF.
FAMILY INTERACTION: Synchronizes the family's medicine pillboxes to one place, in real time. Manage your entire family from one account!
MEDTONES: Various Medtones to make Medisafe playful and a great addition to your day: have President Obama, Darth Vader, Dr Evil, Austin Powers, Elsa or your Nagging Mom remind you about your meds. Choose your medication reminder sound to make Medisafe a comfortable addition to your day.
REMINDERS: Reminds you to take medication doses on time every time, even if your device is asleep. Medisafe has timezone support too! No need to worry while traveling, your reminders are always on time.
REFILL REMINDER: Rx refill reminds you when you need to restock your prescriptions.
PRN FRIENDLY: List PRN (on demand) medication.

Whether you are taking one drug dosage or more, you know how difficult it is remembering each pill right on time. If you are a caretaker for a child, parent, or patient suffering from chronic pain or illness, you know how stressful it is not knowing for sure if your loved one took their medications correctly.

Medisafe does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding your medications or a medical condition.
