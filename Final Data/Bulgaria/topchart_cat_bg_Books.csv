Царският Четвероевангелието на Иван Александър е осветен ръкопис Евангелие Book в Близкия български, подготвени и илюстрирано на 1355-1356 за цар Иван Александър на Втората българска държава. Ръкописът е смятан за един от най-важните ръкописи на средновековната българска култура. Ръкописът, сега в Британската библиотека (Добавяне. MS 39627), съдържа текста на четирите евангелия, илюстрирани с 366 миниатюри и се състои от 286 пергаментови фолиа, 33 с 24.3 см в размер. 

Библейски преводи на съвременната българска дата от 1820 и до голяма степен са организирани от протестантските мисионери. Българската православна църква първоначално предпочита да продължи използването на Старобългарски език.

Архимандритът Теодосий, игумен на манастир Бистрица в Румъния, в превод на Новия завет за Британското и чуждестранно библейско общество, която е отпечатана в Санкт Петербург през 1823 г. . ""Той беше започнал от архимандрит Теодосий, със санкцията на Григорий, патриарх на Константинопол. (Евангелието на Матей в църковно славянски и български 1823) е публикувана от руския библейско общество. "" Този опит да преведат Библията на съвременен български се характеризира с беден граматичен стил и е силно повлиян от версията на църковнославянски. Цялото издание е изпратен в Санкт Петербург и се казва, че са били унищожени там. The BFBS също бяха договорени националистическа журналист Константин Фотинов, който в превод на Новия Завет, но BFBS не го одобряват, защото ""той не е бил нито Слав [ONIC], нито български"". 

Един независим опит да се публикува превод на български език на Новия завет настъпили през 1828 г., тъй като Петър Сапунов и брат му отец Серафим публикува превод на четирите евангелия в столичния пресата Букурещ във Влашко (Румъния). Този превод е завършена в източната част на български диалект.

През 1835 г. български монах Неофит Рилски започна нов превод на Новия завет. Преводът  е завършена на 18 април, 1838 г. Преводът е направен в български диалект от областта на Горна Джумая (дн Благоевград в района на Македония) .През 1840 5000 копия на първия пълен превод на новия Testament са отпечатани в Смирна от британското и чуждестранно библейско общество. А второ издание, което се отпечатва в Смирна през 1850 г. е бил почти точно препечатка на изданието 1840. А трето издание, последван през 1853 г. с 15,000 копия. Четвъртото издание е публикувано през 1857 г. в Букурещ, както и за вида първи път граждански герои е бил използван. През 1859 г., по две издания бяха публикувани. През 1866 г., ново издание ""джоб"" с текст ревизиран от Илайъс Ригс и д-р Алберт Лонг е отпечатана в Цариград. Новият завет е ревизиран и препечатани общо девет пъти.

В периода 1840-1860 на (Търново) диалект Източна бе приет като литературен български език и на македонски диалект, в който е била преведена на Новия Завет, е бил широко отхвърлен. До 1858 Неофит Рилски свърши голяма част от Стария завет. Ригс среща с Неофит Рилски и обсъди евентуално преразглеждане на българския Нов Завет, за да се отстранят македонския диалект елементи. Неофит възрази преразглеждане, така че Ригс взе превода и се връща в Константинопол. В януари 1859 Ригс покани българския учител Христодул Kostovich да му помогне с преразглеждането.",2016-09-30T01:51:26Z,2016-09-30T01:51:26Z
