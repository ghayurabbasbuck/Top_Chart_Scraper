What people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:

- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.
by jefffafa123

- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!
by AndyLPhoto

- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!
by AwesomeV01

- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.

• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.
• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.
• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the ""Relative Altitude"" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).
• Notification about pressure change. ""Notification custom rule"" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.
Notify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.
• ""Pressure Tracking"" and ""History Graph"" require ""Background App Refresh"" or ""Always Location Service"" with ""Exact update interval"" (paid feature) enabled.
• ""My Area"" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.

bg,Bulgaria,Weather,6001,23,1266448783,Aurora Forecast 3D,UNIS Co2 LaB AS,https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/aurora-forecast-3d/id1266448783?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Weather,"The Aurora Forecast 3D is a tool to track down where the aurora is located in the sky from any location on planet. It renders Earth in 3D with rotation and scaling at your fingertips. You can select locations and make your own ground - station list. The Sun illuminates the globe as it updates in near real-time. The short term forecasts are up to +6 hours, while the long term forecasts are up to 3 days ahead in time. They are updated when the app is active and connected to internet.

An Aurora Compass is included that shows where the auroral oval [1,2], the Moon and the Sun are located as you look up at the sky from your location. The phase and age of the Moon is also visualized in the compass. By zooming out in the 3D view port, satellites, stars and planets appear in their orbits [3] around the Sun.

FEATURES
- 3D view port of Earth.
- Solar illumination of the Earth and the Moon.
- Aurora oval size and location in real time.
- Day side location of the red Cusp. 
- Forecasts based on predicted Kp index estimated by the Space Weather Prediction Centre (NOAA-SWPC).
- Includes a 2.4 million star map [4]. 
- City light texture [5].
- Earth, Sun and Moon textures [6,7].
- Sky view module to track planets and stars [8].
- 3-day space weather condition forecast as news ticker.
- Two-Line Element (TLE) satellite orbit calculations [9].
- Skyview navigation.
- 3D Laser Star pointer to identify star signs.
- Sounding rocket trajectories.
- Sun and Moon daily elevation plots with rise and set time.
- Epoch selection for magnetic pole position [10]
- Ovals based on polar orbiting satellites data [11]
- Target web links added to satellites, stars, planets and position.
- All-sky camera links to the Boreal Aurora Camera Constellation (BACC).
- Sky color animation [12,13].
- Zhang and Paxton ovals [14].
- Earth shadow calculations in twilight 
- Youtube demonstration.
