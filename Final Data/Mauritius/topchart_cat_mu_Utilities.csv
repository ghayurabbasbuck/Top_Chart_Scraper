NordVPN is an easy-to-use VPN app for an iPhone or iPad, trusted by millions of users worldwide. It shields your online activities from nosy advertisers, cybercriminals, and intrusive internet service providers. How? By stopping trackers and encrypting your traffic to make it unreadable to anyone trying to take a peek at your browsing. 

Why NordVPN?

TURBO SPEEDS

We do everything we can to give you VPN connection speeds that are hard to beat. That includes creating custom protocols so you can have super-fast connections without sacrificing security.

Whatever it is — app issues, VPN connection problems, or payment options — we’ll sort it. Browse the Support Center, write an email, or visit our website for a live chat with customer support. 

POWERFUL ONLINE SECURITY

NordVPN secures your iPhone data with next-generation encryption algorithms. It would take millions of years to decrypt — so you know the information you send and receive is safe.

Features our users love:

• Strong VPN encryption for top-grade security.
• Unlimited VPN data for internet freedom.
