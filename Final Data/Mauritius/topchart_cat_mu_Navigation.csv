-Track connected devices,
-Find out the location of any phone; regardless of the installed program,
-See the history of locations & many more

iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.

Now, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation but also the places they have visited during the past 60 days.

Install iMapp and you will be able to:

• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service 
• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)
• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days
• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created
• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones
• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish
• create your own places on the map
• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode
• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives
• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way
• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.


The accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone numbers or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened whenever you want to update the person's location.

If you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.

iMapp has the following subscriptions:

iMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr
iMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr
With Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone, and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3-day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account.
