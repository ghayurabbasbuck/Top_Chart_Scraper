Moreover, SmartBP interfaces with Apple Health, providing your health data at your fingertips, and enabling you to be proactive in your own wellbeing. For those grappling with prehypertension or hypertension, SmartBP can aid in tracking progress, spotting trends, and managing all your blood pressure and heart measurements, with the ultimate goal of improving your overall cardiovascular health and blood pressure. SmartBP is a more intelligent way to handle your blood pressure readings and track your improvement.

Disclaimer:

- SmartBP permits you to log, track, and evaluate trends in your blood pressure. You can manually input your readings or use a blood pressure monitor to synchronise with SmartBP through Apple Health. SmartBP in itself does not measure blood pressure. A separate blood pressure monitor is required for this.

- SmartBP Cloud Sync is not a replacement for backing up your health data. While we strive for the highest data security, no measures can ensure 100% protection. Regular data backups are the user's responsibility.

Not too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.
- Track your pregnancy journey. Get weekly insights on pregnancy symptoms, learn how to read ultrasound scans, monitor contractions, and keep track of your baby’s movements with a kick counter.

For best results:

- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.
- Use the app in a quiet room
- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)
- Put the phone in Airplane Mode
- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press ""Record"" to create a recording
- Use AirPods

Watch wonderful ultrasound videos of babies in different weeks of pregnancy. If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.

ScanBaby is divided into three different modes:

-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.

-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.

-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.
