mu,Mauritius,Reference,6006,7,6748571304,SalahScreen: Prayer Focus,Rayane Sahi,https://apps.apple.com/mu/app/salahscreen-prayer-focus/id6748571304?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Reference,"SalahScreen automatically blocks distracting apps when it's time to pray so you can show up for worship without the battle. No willpower needed. Just presence.

THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO WELL

You know you should pray on time. But your phone knows how to keep you scrolling. One notification becomes five minutes. Five minutes becomes a missed prayer. And even when you do pray, your mind is still half-tangled in what you just saw on your screen.

You're not weak. Your brain has been conditioned for constant stimulation. Prayer requires the opposite: stillness, focus, presence. SalahScreen bridges that gap.

HOW SALAHSCREEN WORKS

Auto-Schedules from Adhan
Prayer times trigger automatic blocking windows. Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha—your phone knows when it's time, so you don't have to remember.

Choose What Gets Blocked
Select by category (Social, Video, Games) or tap individual apps. Clear ""Blocked"" badges show what's paused during prayer.

Pray to Unblock
When prayer time ends, a gentle prompt asks if you have prayed. Resume intentionally, not impulsively. Need flexibility? Quick Pause gives you 5 minutes.

Post-Prayer Reflection
Close each prayer with a 30-second journal. Add quick tags, write a note, or just breathe. Turn ritual into remembrance.

Daily Ayah & Hadith
Arabic text with translation. Simple daily inspiration to keep you connected.

Build the Habit
Track streaks and consistency. No pressure. No guilt. Just clarity on your progress.

WHAT YOU'LL EXPERIENCE

- Instant relief – No more battling yourself at prayer time. The apps are just... gone.

- Improved focus within days – Your mind learns that prayer time means prayer, not multitasking.

- Sustainable routine in 3 weeks – Consistency without willpower. The habit builds itself.

- Spiritual transformation over months – Prayers that feel present. Connection that feels real.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS

""I used to feel so guilty missing prayers because I got lost scrolling. Now I don't even have to think about it. SalahScreen just handles it.""

""My screen time dropped 2+ hours per day. But more importantly, my khushoo improved. I actually feel present now.""

""Finally, a tool that understands Muslim rhythms. This isn't just another app blocker—it's built around salah.""

WHO THIS IS FOR

Students juggling classes and social media. Professionals drowning in notifications. Parents trying to model good habits. Anyone who's tired of feeling like their phone controls them instead of the other way around.

If you're struggling to pray on time, if your mind wanders during salah, if you're exhausted from the constant battle with your device—this is for you.

YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS

- On-device processing only
- No account required
- Uses standard iOS Screen Time permissions
