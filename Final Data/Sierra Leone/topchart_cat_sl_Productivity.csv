Inspectors can log each patrol with date, time, GPS spot, span or tower number, weather, issues found, and how serious the problem is, all in one place. Wire height checks are easy too, with simple forms for span ID, GPS, measured height, tool used, and field notes. The app keeps all patrol and wire height records tidy and ready to review later. Built-in converters let you switch load and force units (N, kN, kgf, lbf) and angle units (degrees, radians, slope %) in a few taps. You can also change GPS coordinates between DMS and decimal degrees without leaving the app. Extra tools convert speed (m/s, km/h, mph), tension (kN, lbs, daN), and elevation or height (m, ft), so field staff do not need a calculator.
