It allows you to create, visualize, modify, validate, format and save your JSON documents.

The app has the smarts needed to make the minimum changes when editing a file, even in the ""outline"" mode. 
This is especially useful when you keep the files in a repository, because only the relevant changes will be shown when diff-ing the edited files.

MAJOR FEATURES
• View and edit your JSON documents in ""outline"" (aka ""tree"") or ""text"" modes
• The ""outline"" mode offers a great and error proof way to manipulate your JSON, by allowing you to easily add, reorder, delete, copy & paste the items
• The ""text"" mode offers a quick way to interact with the raw text which makes up the JSON and to investigate invalid JSONs

OUTLINE MODE
• Perform standard operations: cut, copy, paste, delete, reorder
• Edit keys & values
• Sort sibling items or the children of a parent item
• Sort the entire JSON by tapping the ""Key"" or ""Value"" columns
• Auto-detect if the document is human readable or compact, and preserve this format
• Find & Replace - configure where the Find (and replace) will take place: in ""Key"" column or ""Value"" column or both.
• Duplicate items
• Change font & font size for better readability
• Undo & redo
• More customization options available in ""More ->Settings -> Outline Editor"" 

TEXT MODE
• Syntax coloring, auto-indentation and line numbers
• Customize the syntax colors, both for the light and dark appearances
• Validate the JSON document
• Highlight of the validation errors, along with a description of them
• Make the JSON document human readable or compact, even if it is not entirely valid
• Find & Replace
• Change font & font size for better readability
• Undo & redo
• More customization options available in ""More -> Settings -> Text Editor""

IMPORTANT: JSON Editor is available as free to download, but a few features are disabled by default: Save documents, Find & Replace, Sort.
In order to get the most out of the app, and to enable the aforementioned features, ""Premium"" is recommended to be purchased (""Premium"" is a one-time in-app purchase).",2024-04-30T07:00:00Z,2025-03-05T12:11:08Z
