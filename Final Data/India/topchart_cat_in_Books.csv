About 'Nitnem': -

Nit-Nem (literally Daily Naam) is a collaboration of different banis that were designated to be read by Sikhs every day at different times of the day. Sikhs read nitnems at Gurdwaras. The Nit-Nem bani's usually include the Panj bania (5 bani'below) which are read daily by baptized Sikhs in the morning between 3:00 am and 6:00 am (this period is considered as Amrit Vela or the Ambrosial Hours) and 'Rehras Sahib' in the evening 6pm and 'Kirtan Sohila' at night 9pm.

1. 'Japji Sahib' (amritvela)
2. 'Jaap Sahib' (amritvela)
3. 'Tav-Prasad' Savaiye(morning)
4. 'Chaupai Sahib' (morning)
5. 'Anand Sahib' (All 40 Shabads) (morning)
6. 'Rehras Sahib' (evening)
7. 'Kirtan Sohila' (night)

The 5 morning Banis are usually recited in the early morning while Rehras is read in the evening (around 6pm.) and Kirtan Sohila is recited just before going to sleep at night. More prayers may be added to the Sikh's liking.

We do hope that you will really like reading/ listening to Nitnem Path on our app. Thanks.",2017-05-17T06:33:53Z,2025-08-19T11:37:49Z

It’s now easier to read the Quran on the go, memorize it and listen to your favorite reciters.

This is just the beginning for Quran for iOS. We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com

As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.
