This analysis will be given to you in the form of a detailed video & step-by-step plan – where we will provide important tips and suggestions to help you achieve your ideal credit score.
GoodScore’s credit score is powered by Experian and CRIF High Mark - 2 of the 4 credit bureaus authorized by RBI.
How does GoodScore work?
The information on your credit report summarizes how you manage credit, including payment history, credit accounts, outstanding balances, defaults, credit utilization, credit mix and loan enquiries – all of which are important factors that impact your credit score.
We analyze all your active and closed credit accounts for payment patterns and credit behaviour and offer personalized guidance to help you make the right decisions as you work towards achieving your desired credit score.
GoodScore helps you understand the factors that affect your CRIF and Experian credit scores and gives you a personalized video recording on how to manage your credit.
Our credit score builder service includes the following:
- Monthly tracking of your credit score and detailed report
- Identifying areas which are affecting your credit score
- Tips on how to manage your credit score
- Monthly review of financial decisions and steps taken
Check your credit score:
You can check your Experian and CRIF High Mark Credit Score any time on the app. Experian and CRIF High Mark are among the four major Credit information companies in India.
We’re also working towards onboarding the other 2 credit bureaus namely CIBIL & Equifax through which you can check your CIBIL score soon. We’ll update you as soon as these credit bureaus are available on the app.
Benefits of using GoodScore:

- Check your credit score and credit report on the go

Are CRIF and Experian credit scores different from CIBIL?
CRIF, Experian and CIBIL are different platforms owned by different credit information companies. However, all 3 companies are approved by the Reserve Bank of India.
The parameters chosen by CIBIL TransUnion, Experian & CRIF High Mark are majorly similar. All 3 companies have a similar mechanism to calculate the credit score. They use repayment history, credit mix, new credit and outstanding debt to make the credit report.
Having a good credit history in CIBIL will have somewhat similar results with CRIF High Mark and Experian as well.
