* Fakna leh Listing awlsam takin i phone atangin i call mai thei - adumavar fakna
* District level newspaper awlsam takin i chhiar thei - adumavar news
* Polls platform-ah i opinion hlu tak hmangin ngaihdan i sawi thei - adumavar polls

What is it?
A mobile app based platform for aggregating local content, news, listings & classifieds (fakna) & polls. The platform is based on a system that is patent pending. The platform has three modules :
- adumavar.fakna
- adumavar.news
- adumavar.polls

How?
Instead of local newspaper agencies having their own independent digital platforms, the innovation is in aggregating and providing them with a single platform to post their news content.

Why should I download the app?
The platform also addresses the issue of localizing advertisements. Currently, each newspaper in a state or region publishes general advertisements that do not always apply to readers in the other local areas. Now you can get your district specific news & ads content all in one place.

Still not convinced?

All of our news are posted by accredited journalists, so if you're tired of all the news that goes around on social media with no verifiable sources, we're sure this is the news app for you. Join the cause and help us fight fake news by downloading the app. Cheers!",2022-08-04T07:00:00Z,2025-08-25T05:28:28Z
