With ConfirmTkt same train alternates, you can find hidden confirm train tickets by changing your boarding/dropping point.

2. Does ConfirmTkt Guarantee Confirm Train Ticket?
No, ConfirmTkt does not guarantee you a confirmed train ticket. But instead, it increases your chance of getting a confirmed train ticket powered by the same train alternates and prediction.

3. How many days in advance can a train ticket be booked for any route?
Train tickets can be booked 60 days in advance on the ConfirmTkt app.
