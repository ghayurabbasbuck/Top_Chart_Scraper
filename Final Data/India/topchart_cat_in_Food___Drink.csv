Popeyes – Our Story
•	Serving since 1972 
•	25+ Countries
•	3300+ Stores 
•	250 Million+ sandwiches served
The year was 1972. A man named Al Copeland dreamed of serving the crunchiest and juiciest fried chicken out there. He crafted the perfect recipe with authentic culinary roots - roots that trace back centuries to New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. What started as one small restaurant and one big idea has now become a global fast-food phenomenon.
Popeyes in India
Jubilant Foodworks brought the joy to India with the launch of Popeyes® in Bengaluru, paving the way for Indian guests to enjoy Popeyes® world-famous menu items, including the brand's Iconic Chicken Sandwich.",2022-01-15T08:00:00Z,2025-07-10T12:07:13Z
