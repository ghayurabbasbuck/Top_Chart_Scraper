Introducing PRORATA! India’s first fractional car ownership platform is where you can co-own your dream car by paying as minimum as 8.33% of the total cost of the car. No! It’s not an EMI, down payment, or loan for the car. 

It’s a co-ownership platform where you split the cost and usage of the car with the residents/colleagues of your society/workspace and upgrade your lifestyle. It’s your 2nd car for occasional & experiential use. 

Download the Prorata app now to understand the full concept and learn how co-owning is more beneficial than renting a car.
