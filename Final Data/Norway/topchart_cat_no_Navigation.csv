This is Octopus Electroverse, the UK & Europe’s largest EV charging network.
It will change how you charge on the go.

—

Access over 1,000,000 chargers with the all-powerful and award-winning Electroverse app and Electrocard. The Electrocard (RFID) is free to order & you can do this through the Electroverse app whenever you like. 

One app. One card. One place for your charging needs.
This is public EV charging made simple.

‘But I’m not an Octopus customer!’ we hear you cry - well, good news, you don’t need to be with Octopus Energy to use Electroverse - it’s open to all!

What’s more, paywalls and hidden fees aren’t our thing - we’re more ‘discounts and inclusivity’. So, once you’ve signed up, you’ll have access to every feature immediately. 

You’ll also only ever get clear and transparent pricing from us. We never mark up charging rates, directly passing through the rate we receive from the relevant network. This also means we’re able to wrangle some discounted deals, so you can start saving on your favourite charging networks.

We’ll see you in the Electroverse soon.

——

App features include:

- Plunge Pricing discounts = On top of our standard discounts, we’ve rolled out Plunge Pricing: discounts when energy prices drop. Green energy = greener discounts.
- Electroverse map toggle = Switches map visibility between all chargers and those compatible with Electroverse. This means you have all the information when selecting a charger.
- Map filters = Search and find charging stations via charging speeds, socket types and preferred networks.
- Detailed Charger Information = Shows live charger availability, a renewable energy icon to help you charge with 100% green energy, and important location details (such as charging costs and other parking restrictions).
- In-app charging = Charge your vehicle via the app! Simply plug in and tap 'start charge' on your phone.
- Route planner = Energise your drive with plotted charging stops along any route! Makes driving long distances a piece of cake.
- Pay, your way = Debit card, Apple Pay, & more. It’s all your choice.
