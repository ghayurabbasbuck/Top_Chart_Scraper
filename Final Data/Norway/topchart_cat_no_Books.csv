As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.
