I tillegg gir appen deg tilgang til de fleste åpne norske podkaster, og er sammen med radiokanalene en god mulighet til å ha all lyd du trenger enkelt tilgjengelig ett sted og overalt.
 
Appen støtter AirPlay, Chromecast og Apple CarPlay. Du kan selv administrere hvilke varsler du ønsker fra oss, og du kan angi annonsepreferanser slik at innholdet blir mest mulig relevant for deg.
 
Ved å logge inn kan vi gi deg mer relevant innhold og en mer moderne brukeropplevelse. Du kan lytte hjemme og fortsette i bilen fordi vi husker podkaster du følger og episoder du hører på tvers av apper og nettsider. Det er raskt og helt gratis å logge inn. Ved å kjenne lytterne våre får vi dypere innsikt i hvordan radiokanalene våre brukes og kan ta bedre beslutninger rundt hvilken musikk, programledere og reklame vi skal servere deg.
 
All bruk av appen er omfattet av våre bruker- og personvernvilkår, som vi ber deg lese: https://www.lydenavnorge.no/personvern.
 
Vi håper Lyden av Norge blir stedet du hører radio og podkast i hverdagen.
