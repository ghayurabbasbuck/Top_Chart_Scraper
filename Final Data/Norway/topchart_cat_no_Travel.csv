Entur gives you travel suggestions from door to door by bus, train, metro, boat and airplane, either if you want to check when the next bus is leaving from your destination, or if you are planning a vacation from Larvik to Lofoten.

The app makes it easy for you to travel with public transport wherever you are in Norway.

Features:
Search is based on your location, so you can easily find the correct stop close to you. The app adapts to your user behavior and shows content that is particularly relevant to you.

The app gives you an overview of:
• Departure and arrival time, also for each line
• Total travel time
• Detailed information on means of transport
• Line number and operator info for each line
• Name and time of arrival at all stops on the journey

Filters give you the flexibility to prefer or sort out transport types, according to your needs.

With the service for departures from stops, you always have an overview of your nearby travel options. Track delays in traffic with real-time updates (where this info is available).

The app is in constant development and is not a finished product. We are now selling a few tickets to public transport, but our goal is that you can plan a trip with several travel providers - and only press ""buy ticket"" once to get all you need.
