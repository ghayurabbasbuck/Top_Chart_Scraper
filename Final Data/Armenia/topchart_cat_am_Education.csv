Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.

Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.

Students can keep track of what's due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks from within Classroom.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has handed in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.

There are many benefits of using Classroom:

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time
The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.

Improves organisation
Students can see all of their assignments on an Assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.

Enhances communication
Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.

Secure
Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, and never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.

Permissions notice:
Camera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.
Microphone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.
Photos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",2015-01-13T08:00:00Z,2025-11-17T17:52:02Z

With the 10-Minute English app, you are going to get better at speaking and understanding the language by expanding your vocabulary—over 500 new words in a month, each month.

*It’s scientifically proven*
 
The method of spaced repetition enables you to remember words and expressions far better than usual lessons. Even in a year, you will be able to recall 90% of everything you have learned.

Our word-building exercises activate your visual memory and improve your language skills. Get one step ahead of everyone who studies English.
 
*It gets you speaking right away*
 
The first 500 most popular words and phrases will serve as a powerful boost for your English. You will learn to describe your life, socialize and speak in the workplace more confidently.

*Read in English and learn words naturally*

With 10-Minute English, you also have the opportunity to read popular books in English. The novels have been specially selected and adapted for your learning. Instantly translate words and sentences and learn them in context — this is a natural and engaging way to enrich your vocabulary.
 
*You learn fast*
 
In 3 months, you will cover a language program designed for a one-year college course.
 
Choose the most compelling ones from 47 up-to-date topics: Travelling and Life in a big city, Business and Job interview, Slang, Hobbies, and many more. Learn top 100 verbs and adverbs to see the improvement immediately.
 
Your aspiration means everything. It doesn’t matter that you don’t have much time to spend on your English studies. Start off with only 10 minutes a day, and this will work wonders for your skills.
 
Begin now, and you’re going to be surprised how good at English you really are.

Access to the 10-Minute English application is offered on a subscription basis. In order to use the app’s services, you will need to subscribe to any of the available plans.
