In the fast-paced modern life, health management is often ""squeezed out"" by busyness—you can’t find paper and pen when you want to record your blood pressure, lack systematic data when you want to analyze blood glucose changes, and have no way to integrate multiple health indicators. To help you break through these troubles, VitalTide APP comes into being. It integrates the recording of multi-dimensional health indicators such as blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate, and serves as your reliable health partner that you can rely on at any time with simple operations and clear data presentation.
Core Features: Comprehensive Coverage to Make Health Data ""Traceable""
1. Accurate Recording: Every Measurement Has a Clear Record
● Blood Pressure Recording: Adapted to Daily Monitoring Scenarios  
Whether it is the basic blood pressure measurement after getting up in the morning, or irregular monitoring during work breaks, after exercise, etc., the APP has a convenient recording entrance. You can quickly save the data by manually entering the measured values, no complicated operations are required, and it is easy to track the fluctuation trend of blood pressure.
● Blood Glucose Recording: Distinguish Scenarios to Facilitate Diet Analysis  
For blood glucose management needs, an intuitive and easy-to-use dedicated interface is designed: it supports distinguishing between ""pre-meal"" and ""post-meal"" records to help you clearly sort out the correlation between diet and blood glucose changes.
2. Multi-Dimensional Coverage: Meet the Needs of Comprehensive Health Management
In addition to blood pressure and blood glucose, the APP also supports the recording of basic indicators such as heart rate, height and weight, and is also equipped with reference for healthy diet guidelines—from basic physiological data to daily diet suggestions, it covers your health management needs in one stop, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools.
Disclaimer
VitalTide APP is only used as a tool for recording and organizing health data. It cannot replace medical equipment nor provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice. If you have any health discomfort, need to obtain professional medical opinions or make medical decisions, please be sure to consult a practicing doctor to ensure your health and safety.",2025-09-18T07:00:00Z,2025-09-25T01:56:08Z

Do you really know what ingredients your favorite foundation contains? The OnSkin app will set your mind at ease by telling you precisely what you’re putting on your skin and whether it's safe for you.

COSMETIC SAFETY SCANNER
With OnSkin, you have a seasoned digital cosmetologist by your side. Choose from three ways to get a product’s safety profile—take a photo of it, scan its barcode, or look up its name on the app. OnSkin will see past the glitz and glamor and decipher the Latin names on the label in a clear way, flagging any potentially harmful components. Plus, the app recommends cleaner alternatives to help you look and feel healthier inside and out.

SCIENCE IS OUR INFLUENCER
The OnSkin product ratings are 100% unbiased—we don’t partner with any brands. Our in-house team of biologists and physicians have used the latest scientific research on toxicology and dermatology to assess over 15,000 cosmetic ingredients. Using an AI calculating algorithm and human curation, we rate products promptly while preserving the quality of manual analysis.

PERSONALIZED SKINCARE TIPS
Just complete a short survey about your skin to get essential care steps and active ingredients to look for when hunting for new products, all tuned to your unique skin and curated by our skin experts. These may be a great kickoff for starting a substantial skincare routine or double-checking your existing one.

SKIN MATCH
Finding suitable products for your skin (especially if it’s acne-prone and sensitive) can be quite a puzzle, but with OnSkin, you’ll always know if a product is a perfect match, a potential match, or not a match for you. Based on the info you input about your skin type and skincare goals, we check how well a product is tailored to your skin needs, so you can invest in effective formulas without having to experiment with your face.

PRODUCT REVIEWS
Viral products seem tempting to give a shot, but how do you check whether it's all just hype before you rush to Sephora? Every week, you’ll see compilations of the top 10 most buzzy products from various categories, from washes to serums. For each, you’ll learn about the powerful and questionable ingredients and their effects, all explained in simple terms. Plus, our skin experts will weigh in on whether it's good value for money! You get to see the real face of raved-about skincare and pick items based on their effects, not just their popularity.
