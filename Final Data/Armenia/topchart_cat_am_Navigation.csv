It helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.

No surprises on the road
Get detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. 
It also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.

Get multi-stop directions
There’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.
Plan a route with 4-10 stops and tap ""Optimize."" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.

Get your bearings anywhere 
No matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.

Never get lost offline
Find places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.

Pay for parking 
Look for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.

Pay for fuel
Choose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.

Steer clear of poor road conditions
Turn on ""Avoid bad and unpaved roads"" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.

Plan your trips ahead of time
Adjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.
For example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.

Get directions tailored to your vehicle
If you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select ""Add truck"" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.

Monitor traffic in real time
Yandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.

See your route laid out in front of you 
Yandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.

It makes meeting planning easier (especially if someone is running late) or allows for spontaneous meetings! Send an emoji to a friend to offer a meeting or start conversation in chat without a need to switch to a messenger.

You can also send a link to your location or route to any person, not just friends. And even create temporary groups for travels. Manage who can see your location. It is convenient, private and helps you to always stay in touch.

This function may be used as a family location finder: add your child or grandmother and grandfather to Friends and you will not have to worry if they don’t respond in a messenger. You will get an automatic push notification when your relative is at home.

Everything about the city. In 2GIS search, you will find contact details of companies and organizations, addresses, business hours, restaurant menus, information on products and services, and even pictures with prices. All information is updated regularly.

Наша база камер и опасностей, вероятно, самая точная. Самое главное – базой пользуется более 5.000.000 пользователей, что обеспечивает оперативное обновление данных по камерам ГИБДД и другим опасностям на дорогах. Мы работаем над ней вместе с пользователями уже больше 10 лет!

HeadUp Display (HUD) – возможность использовать ваш телефон или планшет как проекционный дисплей. Просто положите устройство под лобовое стекло и вы увидите проекцию скорости и предупреждений об опасностях прямо на стекле. Не нужно отвлекаться от дороги - все непосредственно перед вашими глазами!

Ключевые функции:
•  Радар-детектор HUD Speed предупреждает о стационарных камерах, мобильных засадах и других опасностях на Вашем пути, т.е. выполняет функции антирадара (если точнее, то радар-детектора).
•  Звуковые предупреждения о превышении скорости перед камерами, чтобы соблюдать ПДД и не получать лишние штрафы. 
•  Цифровой спидометр. Скорость, определенная по GPS, является более точной, чем показывает спидометр в машине.
•  Отображение данных в проекции на лобовом стекле.
•  Еженедельные бесплатные обновления базы камер, засад ДПС и опасных объектов.
•  Удобный, простой и полностью русифицированный интерфейс.
•  База опасных объектов и камер покрывает все регионы России, Узбекистана, Украины, Беларуси, Казахстана.

Внимание! 

1. Постоянное использование службы определения местоположения (GPS и ГЛОНАСС) в фоновом режиме может значительно уменьшить длительность заряда и срок службы батареи.

2. В солнечную погоду яркости вашего устройства может не хватить для отображения HUD проекции на стекле. В этом случае используйте обычный режим отображения и поставьте устройство в держатель. Ночью, вечером и пасмурную погоду проекция будет всегда хорошо видна!

3. Во время движения ваш смартфон или планшет должен быть надежно зафиксирован с помощью специального держателя или специального коврика и не должен мешать обзору дороги. Окна в машине должны быть закрыты, во избежание вылета устройства при резких поворотах.",2024-01-04T08:00:00Z,2025-11-04T17:27:16Z
