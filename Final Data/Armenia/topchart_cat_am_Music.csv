В приложении для музыки можно слушать любимые треки и открывать новые — благодаря сниппетам, плейлистам настроений и рекомендациям от алгоритмов, пользователей, сообществ и редакции.

Точные рекомендации музыки
VK Микс — обновлённая система рекомендаций. Это бесконечный плейлист треков в вашем вкусе, который генерируют алгоритмы. Выбирайте настроение, узнаваемость и язык, применяйте настройки и включайте свой VK Микс. 
Возможность открывать новую музыку

• «Сниппеты» — лёгкий способ найти музыку. Зажмите трек, чтобы послушать  яркий фрагмент и оценить, нравится вам песня или нет.  
• «Какой сейчас вайб» — плейлисты настроений от алгоритмов на основе треков,  которые вам нравятся.
• В разделе «Обзор» собраны эксклюзивные релизы, новинки, чарт треков и  альбомов, подборки от редакции. 
• В разделе «Слушайте друг друга» можно найти новые песни и тех, с кем у вас  совпадает музыкальный вкус.
• Меломаны оценят миксы по жанрам и артистам — плейлисты со знакомыми  треками и похожими на то, что вы часто слушаете. 

Своя коллекция
В разделе «Моя музыка» хранится всё, что вам понравилось. История прослушивания, альбомы, плейлисты, любимые радиостанции и скачанные треки — на одном экране и в быстром доступе.

Удобный плеер
Включайте трек, открывайте плеер и управляйте музыкой. Прямо здесь доступна очередь треков и тексты к ним. Если музыка нравится — добавляйте в коллекцию, если нет — отмечайте дизлайком. Попробуйте «Микс по треку» — подборку музыки, похожей на трек, который сейчас слушаете. Скачивайте песни и слушайте музыку без интернета.

Подкасты в VK Музыке 
В разделе «Книги и шоу» собраны сотни подкастов обо всём на свете: научпоп, психология, культура, юмор и многое другое. Выбирайте и слушайте то, что интересно вам.Радио в VK Музыке Вам доступны десятки радиостанций с разной музыкой — включайте любимое радио и слушайте без помех и перерывов.

Аудиокниги в VK Музыке
В разделе «Книги и шоу» вы найдёте множество книг разных жанров в аудиоформате: мировые бестселлеры, классика, современные произведения, детская литература и эксклюзивные аудиосериалы. Редакция собирает тематические подборки и каждый месяц обновляет раздел «Сейчас бесплатные» — книги, которые можно слушать без подписки.

Подписка позволяет убрать все ограничения в приложении:

• Никакой рекламы и перерывов на самом интересном. 
• Музыка онлайн и офлайн — скачивайте музыку на телефон и слушайте без интернета.
• Музыка с выключенным экраном — ничего не остановится, когда вы свернёте приложение или заблокируете экран.
• Доступ к полной коллекции аудиокниг — классика, новинки от издательств, бестселлеры и эксклюзивы, которые выходят только в VK Музыке.

Подписка на VK Музыку
• Подписка продлевается автоматически. Если хотите отменить подписку, это  нужно сделать не менее чем за 24 часа до того, как она продлится на новый месяц.
• Если удалить приложение, подписка сохранится: отменить её можно только  вручную. 
• Если вы отменили подписку, она продолжит работать до конца оплаченного  периода и потом отключится. Вернуть деньги за текущую подписку не получится. 
• Вы можете управлять подпиской или отключить автопродление в настройках  своей учётной записи Apple ID. Для этого авторизуйтесь под той же учётной  записью, с которой оформляли подписку.
• Бесплатный пробный период доступен один раз. Если вы использовали не весь  период, остаток аннулируется после покупки подписки.
