Shifted Fate
Amy was the Luna of her pack, growing a pup in her stomach when the alpha betrayed her and took her life, and that of her pup. When she woke up six years earlier she decided to change everything. Revenge would be something she focused on.

Justice For Juniper
""Your husband cheated with my wife,"" her boss said. Juniper froze, watching the betrayal on screen, pain tearing through her belly. “My baby...” When she woke again, she saw the three powerful men rushing into her room filled with regret and desire... 

Mated to Two Bad Boy Alphas
Ever since Lia spilled juice on Zane Adams at six, his friends made her life miserable—but when the mysterious Blake shows up to protect her, everything changes. Now, both boys want her…and on her sixteenth birthday, she hears them both growl “mine.” 

Tempting The Mafia Twins
My Mafia husband slept with the woman who killed our baby, and his sister filmed it.  
I tipped off the FBI about his crimes and fled his insane mob family.  
Now, he's locked down the entire city just to hunt me down. 

The Pack's Doctor
Yara is a werewolf, hiding in a human university, studying medicine. One day, when Yara is out letting her wolf run, she comes across Alpha Warren, caught in a bear trap. She saves him, but surprisingly finds out he was her mate.  Warren, a strong and powerful Alpha, finally finds his mate. He's unwilling to let her go, so he took Yara to his pack.

Not Rejected Just Unwanted
All Raine Andrew wanted was a mate. She wanted a mate to love her and make her feel wanted. And when she turns 17, she gets her mate: soon-to-be-Beta Elijah Woods. He's a great guy. He's loyal to his pack, a straight-A student, and a very hard worker.
He sounds like the perfect mate, right? Raine thought so too, but there's just one problem: He doesn't want her.

Mated to My Bully
Amanda Stevens thought her problems were over when she got to college. No longer the shy, awkward teen she was in high school, Amanda felt this was her chance at making new friends and experiencing life. That was until she found out her high school Bully was attending the same college she was. Hudson Harlow. 
The moment that Hudson Harlow looked into the hazel eyes of Amanda Stevens, his wolf started to howl MATE! Why in the world would the Moon Goddess mate him to a human? But Hudson started to notice that this was no longer the girl that he tormented in High School. She'd changed. 
Hudson, knowing how awfully he treated Amanda in high school, had to now convince her to forgive him and accept him as her mate. 
Not only did Amanda have to deal with Hudson, but she also had to juggle her classes, a new job, and strange animal attacks on campus. All Amanda wanted was a normal college life.

His Broken Luna
Battered, abused, and broken, Sophia Alden is resigned to living the rest of her life as a slave to Alexander, a powerful Alpha who considers her his property and is dangerously obsessed with her. 
But when the Alpha of the most powerful pack comes to claim his true mate, hearts are broken, dangerous enemies are made, and Sophia finds herself thrust into a world of lies, lust, secrets, and desires that threatens to douse her in its burning flame, consuming her entire being.

All of these and more will be at your fingertips. Download Readict today!

Both books contain God's guidance as revealed to prophets, as well as religious histories of different civilizations. While the Bible is written by and about the people in the land of Israel and surrounding areas and takes place from the creation of the world until shortly after the death of Jesus Christ, the Book of Mormon contains the history of God's dealings with the people who lived in the Americas between approximately 600 BC and 400 AD. The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ.
