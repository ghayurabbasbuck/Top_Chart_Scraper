When you choose Firefox, you’re choosing to stay private, stay focused, and stay in charge.

PRIVACY WHERE IT MATTERS MOST
Firefox blocks hidden trackers that follow you around the internet and slow down your browsing. Want more control? Switch Enhanced Tracking Protection to Strict mode for extra protection across all your tabs. Or browse in a private window — your search and browsing history disappears when all your private tabs are closed.

DIFFERENT DEVICES. SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT
Start a search on your phone and pick it up on your laptop — or vice versa. With a Mozilla account, your open tabs, history, and bookmarks travel with you. Firefox can even suggest strong passwords when you’re creating a new account and securely store them so they’re available across all your devices.

STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN
Pick up right where you left off. Your open tabs are intuitively grouped and displayed, along with recent bookmarks, top sites, and popular articles.

FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR
Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search query and get suggested and previously searched results across your preferred search engines.

ORGANISE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE
Open as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails, making it easy to quickly find what you want.

SHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS
Easily share links to web pages or specific items on a page, with quick access to your most recently used apps.

BILLIONAIRE-FREE FOR OVER 20 YEARS
The Firefox browser was created in 2004 by Mozilla as a faster, more private, and more customisable alternative to other web browsers. Today, we’re still not-for-profit, still not owned by any billionaires, and still working to make the internet — and the time you spend on it — better.
