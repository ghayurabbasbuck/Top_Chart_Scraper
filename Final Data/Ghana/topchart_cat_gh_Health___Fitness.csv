Positive reminders are one of the simplest and most powerful tools for mental growth. It’s all about keeping the right thoughts on top of mind. The app provides daily affirmations or an extra push in your tough times or just a mood change with positive reminders - the app helps you gain it. Some of the great features of the app are listed below! 





Daily Motivation app spiritualized the experience of one's self that the chosen is around and something better is yet to come. Through positive affirmations that a self can see on the phone widget or apple watch, one stands motivated with the notion that ""I am Beautiful"", “I am Strong”, I am positive”, “I am a better than this” or “the chooser is with me” 





Reminding oneself through daily affirmations is the simplest and extremely powerful method to increase daily motivation. It's all about bringing mental strength with a beautiful thought or a reminder of affirmations. These affirmations can be self-created, from someone known or the chooser as stated in religious scriptures
 
The new version of the app can allow the users to bring these positive quotes directly on their phone widget screen or icon on the apple watch. The widgets can be customized with extremely beautiful and interactive wallpapers that also mirror the apple watch.





Motivation can be shared throughout social media with a few clicks, be it a story post on Instagram, post on Instagram or a daily affirmation to a friend on WhatsApp. Sayings from entrepreneurs or the chooser are one of our favorites. 



A self can add his own motivation quote, customize the fonts, add a background image and share with friends and family or just remind others about the beautiful thought. It acts as a gesture of positivity and shared love
 
Save Your Positivity


The app provides users to save the quotes they link with a simple save or liked icon provided on each scroll. These saved and liked sayings can anytime be accessed through the saved libraries 





Daily quotes categories


The motivation app has numerous categories which are situation or event-based. The user can select the most suitable categories and enjoy the sayings from within the quotes. Such categorization helps most specifically the users who like to see and read sayings from the chooser, entrepreneurship, breakups, bible verses, self-management, and others. 





Mood Booster Motivation from the chooser


Users who are going through tough times like depression, mood disorders, anxiety, eating disorders, or affected mental health can increase self-esteem and boost self morale with daily reminders on apple watch or phone widgets.




The app includes a wide range of topics such as self-esteem, relationships, and dealing with stress, as well as a selection of carefully designed themes to choose from - updated frequently.
