Fido personal credit and business loans are intended to assist entrepreneurs and individuals with their everyday needs and not to service long-term debt obligations. Maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 36%. Actual rates may be lower, depending on local applicable laws and regulations. This is based on a credit line term of 365 days (one year), an interest of 0.098% per day or 2.94% per month, a processing fee of 295 GHS per credit line, and in certain cases, a deductible commitment fee of up to 1.6%.

Representative Example in Ghana Cedi:
A borrower who receives credit of 2,000 GHS for a 365 days term, will be charged an interest rate of 0.098% per day, thus 408.7 GHS in 365 days, and a processing fee of 295 GHS, summing up to a total repayment of 703.7 GHS. A deductible 1.4% commitment fee is applied, and 28 GHS will be deducted from the principal.

‏In summary: 2,000 GHS (borrowed amount), minus 28 GHS (commitment fee) + 408.7 GHS (interest) + 295 GHS (processing fee) = 2,703.7 GHS (total payment).
The borrower has the flexibility to make early repayments at any point, thereby reducing the above-stated interest.
