NurseAI is built for nurses, clinical staff, and community health workers who need quick, reliable answers during their workflow. In this first release, we’ve focused on the three features that make the most difference at the bedside and in the community.


1. Drug Reference Guide


Search by generic or brand name to access trusted information on drug indications, standard dosing, contraindications, side effects, and nursing considerations.


• Data Sources: FDA Open Data (Drug Labeling API) and RxNorm API.
• Key Benefit: Instant, evidence-based medication lookups without flipping through manuals.
• Offline Capability: Core drug data stored locally for faster, reliable access.

2. SDOH Screening & Local Resource Finder


Identify patient needs beyond the clinic using a structured Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) questionnaire covering housing, food, transportation, safety, and more. NurseAI then recommends local resources based on the user’s ZIP code.


•Screening Tool: CMS Accountable Health Communities (AHC) format.
•Local Resource Finder: Integrated with findhelp.org and other directories.
•Goal: Address non-medical barriers to health by connecting patients to real community support


Why Choose NurseAI?

• Focused on workflow speed and accuracy.
• Built on trusted data sources (FDA, RxNorm, CMS, findhelp.org).
• Designed with a HIPAA-conscious architecture—local storage for PHI-sensitive tools.
• Simple, clean interface with smart search functionality.

It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.

* Scientific Research *

The popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.

You can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.

* Full Version *

This is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:

- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.
- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.
- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.
- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.

* How to Use *

To generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:

- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).
- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).
- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).

The application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen.",2013-11-20T00:19:39Z,2021-05-10T20:49:44Z

You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   

It contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.

Then for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.

Finally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.

As an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website.",2015-03-23T04:43:07Z,2018-02-07T22:06:59Z
