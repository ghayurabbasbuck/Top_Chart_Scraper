PROTECT YOUR INCOMING MESSAGES

ADD NUMBERS TO THE DATABASE

CREATE YOUR OWN BLACKLIST
Decide what to do with unwanted callers. Do you want to block them from ever calling you? Or do you want to leave them access but be warned when their number comes up? Or do you want to deal with each number individually? It's all up to your decision.

REVERSE LOOKUP AND SEARCH NUMBERS
You can also compare any missed calls from unknown numbers with the database list and find out the identity of the caller easily.
