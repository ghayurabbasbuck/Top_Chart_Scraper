Zest integrates a mind-blowing cooking education into your routine. Learn to cook with us through step-by-step explanations of foundational cooking concepts in fewer than 10 minutes and dishes that bring the concept to life. Our recipes are created by two former Michelin star chefs, distilled by a home chef, and cooked by you, the superstar home cook that you are (or will be). We don't assume any prior culinary knowledge. We meet you where you are and help you improve.
 
Stop copying traditional recipes - start learning from Zest. We've cooked those delicious Bon Appetit dinners. But when we took away the recipes we felt like lost puppies. Zest is designed to teach you the how's and why's of cooking. So when the recipe is gone you can confidently navigate the kitchen. The promise: Taste improvement after one dinner with Zest.

FEATURES:

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
We've all tried cooking a TikTok recipe. You rewatch the video 13 times to figure out what the hell is going on. Zest embeds videos throughout recipes so you can click into content when you need it. No more pausing and restarting. Learn at your own pace.
 
CONCEPT VIDEOS
Watch a short video on a new concept at your own pace and then cook recipes that reinforce what you've learned. We dive into topics like the science of tasting and the basics of seasoning, sautéing, roasting and more!

SKILL VIDEOS
Don't know how to dice an onion? Don't be embarrassed, we got you covered. Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).

CURATED MENU
Choose a menu to fit your preferences. Tired of wasting produce? Search for dishes including what’s already in your fridge. Got allergies? Compile safe recipes in your menu to find them when you’re ready to get cooking. 

GROCERY LIST
Shop your menu with our automated grocery list. Plus, utilize our helpful tips while you shop. Don't know what a neutral oil is? We got you covered.

PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Rate the recipes you cook, so we can recommend similar ones.
