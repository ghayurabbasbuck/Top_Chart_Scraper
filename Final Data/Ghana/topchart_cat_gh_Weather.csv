""I live in the mountains, so Snow-Forecast.com is not just a winter site for me; it's useful year-round. It's the first and last website I check every day. I use it to plan my days: if it's work, I rely on it to make decisions about filming windows; if it's playtime, it's even more important to get it right, as that time is the most precious.” - Ed Leigh - Commentator & Presenter of BBC Ski Sunday
