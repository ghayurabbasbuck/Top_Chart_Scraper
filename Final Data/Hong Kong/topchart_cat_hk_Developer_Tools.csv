These four capabilities form the core workflow of Surge:
· Takeover: You can take over the network connection sent by the device. Surge supports both proxy service and virtual NIC takeover.
· Processing: You can modify the network requests and responses that have been taken over. This includes URL redirection, local file mapping, custom modification using JavaScript, and many other methods.
· Forwarding: You can forward the taken over network requests to other proxy servers. This can be global forwarding or with a flexible rule system to determine an outbound policy.
· Intercept: You can intercept and save specific data of network requests and responses, and you can also decrypt HTTPS traffic with MITM.

Highlighted Features
· Takeover all HTTP/HTTPS/TCP traffic from any applications on your device, and redirect to an HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5/SOCKS5-TLS/SSH proxy server following highly configurable rules.
· Used as a WireGuard Client to convert the L3 VPN as a proxy.
· Record and display HTTP requests and responses sent from your iOS devices, including body and header.
· Configure rules using domain match, domain suffix, domain keyword, CIDR IP range, and GeoIP lookup.
· Measure traffic usage and network speed on WiFi, cellular, and proxy connections.
· High performance and suitable for intensive use.
· Block ads by domain rules.
· Local DNS Map (equivalent to /etc/hosts). You can use this function to switch the production/development environment for your app without changing any code.
· All features work on the cellular network.
· Decrypt HTTPS traffic with Man-in-the-Middle.
· Perform URL rewrite.
· Fully IPv6 supports.
· Header rewrite.
· Raw L3 packets capture.
· Safari extension to add rules.
· JSON, text, image and video viewer for the captured body.
· Album mode for the request list.
· Pre-filter for capturing.
· HTTPS proxy protocol supports client-side SSL/TLS certificate validation.

hk,Hong Kong,Developer Tools,6026,19,6451132116,Spider Proxy - HTTP（S）抓包調試工具,"Nanjing Zhuge Culture Media Co., Ltd",https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/spider-proxy-http-s-%E6%8A%93%E5%8C%85%E8%AA%BF%E8%A9%A6%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/id6451132116?uo=4,0.0,5,1,Developer Tools,"Spider Proxy是一款移動端HTTP/HTTPS抓包和網絡調試工具，支持在不連接電腦的情況下直接查看/修改iOS系統的HTTP(S)請求和響應。 Spider Proxy支持記錄並導出網絡請求，還可以進行自定義HTTP(S)網絡調試，包括URL重定向、自定義參數等。

升級至Spider Proxy VIP，同時支持4個輔助設備，並可在設備之間一鍵上傳和共享數據。 VIP還允許用戶根據需要為設備設置單獨的授權規則並隨時取消授權。

怎麼運行的
Spider 代理將在設備上創建 VPN 配置。當啟用抓包時，Spider Proxy會在VPN進程中啟動一個本地HTTP代理，所有HTTP流量都會通過VPN轉發到這個本地代理，使得本機上的所有網絡訪問請求都可以通過它完成， 從而劫持並分析所有 HTTP(S) 請求和響應。
 
特徵
1、HTTPS流量分析
2、HTML、JSON、CSS格式預覽
3、規則重寫：實時修改HTTP(S)請求和響應
4、設備授權與數據共享
5、規則加密授權或取消授權
6、數據備份與恢復
7、腳本：支持自定義JavaScript語法進行介面的拓展編寫
8、重放：支持具有介面依賴性和斷言的自定義HTTP（S）網絡請求
9、工具：Base64編解碼、時間戳記轉換、隨機密碼生成、UUID生成、MD5加密、HSA256加密、AES128編解碼、url編解碼、jsfuck加密、DES加密解密、RC4加密解密、Rabbit加密解密、Triple/DES加密解密、UTF8編碼轉換器、ASCII轉換、jjencode加密、顏色轉換、數位轉中文、JSON格式化、JSON對比等。

hk,Hong Kong,Developer Tools,6026,20,1473805438,a-Shell,Nicolas Holzschuch,https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/a-shell/id1473805438?uo=4,0.0,4.25,16,Developer Tools,"a-Shell is a complete local terminal emulator, allowing to run most Unix commands on your iOS device. You can transfer files using scp and curl, edit them with vim and ed, process them using grep, awk and sed. You can work with git repositories using lg2. 
Most commands are compiled for iOS native Arm64 format, making them fast and well integrated with the BSD Unix that powers iOS/iPadOS.

a-Shell includes Python, Lua, Perl, JavaScript, C, C++ for programming and TeX (texlive 2025, with Tikz and LuaTeX) for text processing. 

There are also multiple network utilities: nslookup, ping, whois, ifconfig... Type help for help, help -l to get the full list of commands. 

a-Shell can be controlled from Shortcuts: run commands in order, process files in a-Shell, get the results as text or files, transfer files to other apps...

a-shell uses iOS 13+ “multiple windows” ability, so you can run multiple shells at the same time, with different commands, in different directories. You can edit a file in one window with vim and process it in the other with python. 

Compile your C or C++ programs to webAssembly using clang or clang++, and execute the resulting binary. A complete webAssembly SDK is included (WASI-libc).

a-Shell is the complete version. If you need a smaller app, and you don't need a C compiler, a TeX engine, or numpy and matplotlib, there is a-Shell mini.",2019-10-25T07:00:00Z,2025-11-22T20:14:13Z

This text isn't gonna get any more interesting. I mean, I think we've pretty much covered all the good stuff. Still here? Ummmm, ok. How's everything? Good? Cool cool cool. 

What are you looking for? The app description is over. For real, check out the app. It's way better than hanging out in the App Store this long.

Wow, you're dedicated. Do you just love app descriptions? Weird. OK, we're gonna go now. Bye.
