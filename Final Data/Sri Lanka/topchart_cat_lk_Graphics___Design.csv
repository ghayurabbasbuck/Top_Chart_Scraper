Create any widget you can imagine to perfectly match your style. Get all the info you need, exactly how you want it, without the clutter.

• Easy Widget Creation •

You don’t need to be a pro designer. Just know what you want, and let your creativity flow. Add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and place it where you want. Repeat until your widget is perfect, then assign it to a slot and drop it on your home screen. Voila!

The Widgy editor is super simple with just two parts: the preview and the layer list. Edit a layer to tweak its appearance and data. The live preview shows exactly how your widget will look, so no more back-and-forth.

• Everything You Need •

Widgy has all the elements and data sources you could ever need, from system info to weather. Display your data as text, charts, or whatever you like.

• No Limits •

Forget templates. With Widgy, everything is 100% customizable. It’s your widget, your way. The only limit is your imagination.

• Easy Sharing & Discovering •
