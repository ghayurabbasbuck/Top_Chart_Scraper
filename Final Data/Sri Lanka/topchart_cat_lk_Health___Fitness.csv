Fio by Fems is a menstrual tracker app designed to address the unique needs of Sri Lankan women. It tackles three key areas: education, normalization of menstruation, and menstrual cycle management.

Education and Normalization

The app provides educational resources about the menstrual cycle in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. This ensures accessibility for a diverse population. Fio also plays a crucial role in breaking down the stigma surrounding periods. It features a Q&A page where users can get answers from doctors within 48 hours. These fosters open discussions, dispels myths, and creates a safe space for women to talk about their experiences.

Menstrual Cycle Management and Community Building

Fio allows users to conveniently track their menstrual cycles and maintain a calendar. This empowers them to manage their reproductive health effectively. The app goes beyond just being a functional tool. It prioritizes building a supportive community where women can share their experiences without fear of judgment. User privacy is a top concern, and sensitive data will never be leaked.

Empowering Choices and Informed Decisions

Many Sri Lankan women hesitate to use sanitary napkins due to a lack of education and limited access to appropriate options. Fio tackles this issue by educating users on various napkin types, their uses, and the benefits of using them effectively. This empowers women to make informed choices about their menstrual health products. The target audience includes women of all ages, ensuring everyone has access to this valuable information.

Beyond Period Tracking

While Fio offers cycle tracking and ovulation date features, it goes beyond being a simple period tracker. The app utilizes Sri Lankan-developed databases and a secure architecture to address data security concerns. It provides a platform for women to share knowledge, ask questions, and connect with healthcare professionals. This saves them time and money while fostering informed decision-making about their reproductive health. Fio by Fems is more than just a tool; it's a movement for positive change.",2024-09-05T07:00:00Z,2024-10-06T11:18:40Z

Do you really know what ingredients your favorite foundation contains? The OnSkin app will set your mind at ease by telling you precisely what you’re putting on your skin and whether it's safe for you.

COSMETIC SAFETY SCANNER
With OnSkin, you have a seasoned digital cosmetologist by your side. Choose from three ways to get a product’s safety profile—take a photo of it, scan its barcode, or look up its name on the app. OnSkin will see past the glitz and glamor and decipher the Latin names on the label in a clear way, flagging any potentially harmful components. Plus, the app recommends cleaner alternatives to help you look and feel healthier inside and out.

SCIENCE IS OUR INFLUENCER
The OnSkin product ratings are 100% unbiased—we don’t partner with any brands. Our in-house team of biologists and physicians have used the latest scientific research on toxicology and dermatology to assess over 15,000 cosmetic ingredients. Using an AI calculating algorithm and human curation, we rate products promptly while preserving the quality of manual analysis.

PERSONALIZED SKINCARE TIPS
Just complete a short survey about your skin to get essential care steps and active ingredients to look for when hunting for new products, all tuned to your unique skin and curated by our skin experts. These may be a great kickoff for starting a substantial skincare routine or double-checking your existing one.

SKIN MATCH
Finding suitable products for your skin (especially if it’s acne-prone and sensitive) can be quite a puzzle, but with OnSkin, you’ll always know if a product is a perfect match, a potential match, or not a match for you. Based on the info you input about your skin type and skincare goals, we check how well a product is tailored to your skin needs, so you can invest in effective formulas without having to experiment with your face.

PRODUCT REVIEWS
Viral products seem tempting to give a shot, but how do you check whether it's all just hype before you rush to Sephora? Every week, you’ll see compilations of the top 10 most buzzy products from various categories, from washes to serums. For each, you’ll learn about the powerful and questionable ingredients and their effects, all explained in simple terms. Plus, our skin experts will weigh in on whether it's good value for money! You get to see the real face of raved-about skincare and pick items based on their effects, not just their popularity.

POPULAR SCANS
See what products are trending on the app and discover new faves!

GUESS THE SCORE
Test your cosmetic intuition with this quick, fun daily game. Is a product’s safety score above or below 50? Pick it right and get a chance to win Premium and scan products without limits!
