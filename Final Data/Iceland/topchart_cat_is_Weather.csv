Forget raw weather reports.

When you go flying with StationWeather, you will speed up your weather briefing to a few seconds, while getting an even better understanding of current and forecast situations than you ever could with raw reports.

By completely decoding METAR and TAF reports, StationWeather is able to present the data in an intuitive way that you will get with no other weather app. 
Analyze a complete METAR report at a glance. Then head over to Live TAF and instantly see the complete weather report valid at any given time - presented to you on a beautiful and unique user interface.

We know NOTAMs can be time consuming to read, so they’re sorted, filtered, and color coded by their relevance from the start. And because filters are fully customizable, you can tailor NOTAMs just for your specific operation.

StationWeather now also supports live D-ATIS reports for participating airports (currently around 80 US airports).

Worldwide live weather radar coverage in addition to an extensive set of more than 700 weather charts from all ICAO regions will make sure you know your weather before you go. 

By getting access to over 40,000 stations, you will find the one you're looking for. And if a station does not publish its own weather, you can connect it with a nearby station to display those reports instead.

What people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:

- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.
by jefffafa123

- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!
by AndyLPhoto

- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!
by AwesomeV01

- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.
