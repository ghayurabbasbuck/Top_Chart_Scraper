If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Our app uses AI to identify your baby’s needs and gives you pediatrician-approved tips to respond with confidence. Plus, use our calming sound library with white noise, heartbeat, womb sounds, lullabies, and more to help your baby relax and sleep better.

► What You'll Find:
• Instant Cry Analysis
Our custom-trained AI model listens to your baby’s cry and identifies the most likely need—hunger, sleepiness, burping, belly pain, or discomfort.

• Soothing Advice: 
For every reason of cry, you'll get clear, step-by-step tips to calm your baby quickly and gently.

• Relaxing Sound Library
Play the most popular calming sounds like white noise, womb sounds, lullabies, and more, to create a peaceful atmosphere for your little one.

• Baby Care Articles
Expert-reviewed guides on the main reasons babies cry, where you’ll learn how to recognize, soothe, and minimize them in a simple and supportive way.

► How to Use the App
When your baby cries, just open the app and tap one button to analyze. Baby Translator · Cry Analyzer listens to your baby’s cry and within 5 seconds shows the most likely reason: hunger, sleepiness, burping, belly pain or discomfort, and offers gentle guidance to help you soothe your baby with confidence.

► How It Works
It’s not magic — it’s science. Every baby is unique, but research shows that there are common sound patterns in infant crying. These acoustic patterns are linked to a baby’s basic physiological needs such as hunger, sleepiness, burping, gas, or discomfort.

Baby Translator · Cry Analyzer listens to these patterns and matches them with the most likely need.

We built and trained our own machine learning model on carefully labeled datasets of real infant cries. That means thousands of cry samples were analyzed, tagged by experts, and used to “teach” the algorithm how to recognize patterns. Over time, the model became increasingly accurate, distinguishing subtle differences in pitch, rhythm, and tone that are often hard for tired parents to notice.

The result: an app that can analyze your baby’s cry in real time and suggest the most probable reason.

◉ Download Baby Translator · Cry Analyzer today and feel supported in your parenting journey with AI cry recognition, pediatrician-approved guidance, and soothing sounds that help your whole family rest easier.
