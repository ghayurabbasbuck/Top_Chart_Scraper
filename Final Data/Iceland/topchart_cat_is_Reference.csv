In Iceland (our home country), ""Noona"" means ""now"". 

Our goal is to help you book all of your appointments in a single app, without having to make a single phone call, whenever and wherever. So why not now? 

Whether you need a hair cut or a beauty session, a psychologist or a chiropractor, a dentist or a massage - or if your dog just really needs grooming - we've got you covered. 

- Discover the best service providers near you.
- Add your favorites to your home screen for easy access later on.
- See all of your upcoming appointments in one place.
- Move or cancel appointments without making a phone call.

It's a win-win for you and the ones you are booking with. You save time and don't need to make any phone calls, and they don't have to pick up the phone while they are busy with a client (how annoying is that, right?)

Join the revolution today and start booking all your appointments on Noona. 

It's free, and always will be.",2019-05-03T03:33:44Z,2025-05-12T11:56:10Z

Dagurinn breytist svo í vikuryfirlit með því að halla símanum á hlið.

Users can adapt the baby owl, SmáUglan, to their own needs by changing the start-up screen and short-cuts, and choosing the options you use the most.  
 
Among the features of the app is „my day“ which gives you an overview of all your classes, exams, meetings and events each day, all in one place. Your day then changes into your week by tilting the phone on its side. Users can, furthermore, monitor what is happening at their university via news and announcements, see what is for lunch in the cafeteria, and see all their courses and final grades. The app also allows users to clock in and out of Vinnustund.
 
Users only need to sign into the app once the first time it is used, and after that they have the SmáUgla app ready in their pocket; the only thing needed is wi-fi!
