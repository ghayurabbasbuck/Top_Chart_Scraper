Spice up your imagination with a juicy collection of stories that will take you to explore your deepest fantasies. From tender romantic novels to the most secret taboos, one can dream of. The choice is yours.

- Join our community and indulge in your inner desires with original stories curated by the best authors for steamy stories. The stories are added on a daily basis.

Wondering what kind of stories we might bring you? Let's take a sneak peek at a couple.

-- I gulped and straightened up, blushing and feeling hot under her intense gaze. June Watson. The one girl I’ve always had a crush on. Heck, there was no counting the number of dreams I’ve had about her, and all the things I’ve fantasized about us doing.

-- When Amber's mother announced that she would remarry, Amber knew her feelings for James, her future stepfather, were inappropriate. She tried to push her fantasies to older students at the college, but none of them ever seemed to satisfy her. Maybe it was the lack of a father figure in her life, but she was drawn to James almost immediately.

-- The game went on, fired up with wild dares and barely a sprinkle of truths. So far, no one’s tried to escape their dares, Jamie noticed as he watched Sasha and Ava kneel and face each other. Sasha had been dared to make out with someone - she’d picked randomly from pieces of paper with all their names on them.
