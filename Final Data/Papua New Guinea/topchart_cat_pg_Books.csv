EXPERIENCE IT: As you read down the column in one version, when you encounter a verse you'd like to better understand, just move your eyes left-and-right to see how other versions express that verse in its context, and then continue reading the chapter. The idea is to introduce as little eye movement as possible, so you can get into the Scriptures and stay there for a while.

BIBLICAL LANGUAGES: See Hebrew and Greek in parallel with other versions. Plus tap any word to lookup the corresponding Hebrew or Greek word and its occurrences. Plus tap any verse to lookup Hebrew or Greek details in a verse: phonetics, parsings, parts of speech, translation tips.

GO DEEPER: Tap any word, then tap “word study” to see: verse lists, lexical entries, and word families. Tap any verse, then tap “verse study” to see verse-at-a-time helps: color-coded parts-of-speech, word forms, phonetics, syllables, and translation tips. It also helps you find familiar Bible verses, even when you only remember a few words; enter ""God so loved"" in the search box and see where that phrase occurs in every Bible version in your parallel Bible.

PROTESTANT, CATHOLIC: This app automatically aligns verses—by verse content—and displays corresponding verse numbers when different.

COMMENTARY FREE: The act of reading versions in parallel helps readers to understand more deeply. Even without commentary. We feel this is so important that we do not include commentary in our app.

LANGUAGES: Biblical Hebrew and Greek plus English, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and about 50 others.
