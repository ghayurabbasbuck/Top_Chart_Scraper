Don't put yourself or your loved ones at risk by missing a dosage -- or taking a double dose because nobody tracked. Our mission is giving people the tools, support and information they need to take their medications the way they're supposed to.

Pharmacists rank Medisafe #1 out of 461 apps they've tested, and MyVCM has recognized Medisafe for HIPAA ""leadership and best practices in managing security and compliance.""

That's why millions have downloaded Medisafe, the top-rated medication manager and pill reminder for those who need reminders to take meds, fertility drugs, birth control, and other medicines.

Download Medisafe and start managing your medications, pills, refills, drug interactions, measurements and doctors' appointments to improve your health. Medisafe is the best pill tracker and planner on the App Store. Never forget to take your medications again! 

Also featured on Fox TV, ABC, Mashable, Inc. Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Life Hacker, Fast Company, TechCrunch, and many more.

Here's why Medisafe is the best:
CLEAN & SIMPLE: Visual and easy medical manager to handle drug reminders.
HEALTH APP INTEGRATION: Keeps track of your measurements and syncs them to the HealthKit app: blood glucose, blood pressure, weight, pulse and temperature.
REPORT SHARING: See your progress report and send it to the doctor or nurse as a visual informative PDF.
FAMILY INTERACTION: Synchronizes the family's medicine pillboxes to one place, in real time. Manage your entire family from one account!
MEDTONES: Various Medtones to make Medisafe playful and a great addition to your day: have President Obama, Darth Vader, Dr Evil, Austin Powers, Elsa or your Nagging Mom remind you about your meds. Choose your medication reminder sound to make Medisafe a comfortable addition to your day.
REMINDERS: Reminds you to take medication doses on time every time, even if your device is asleep. Medisafe has timezone support too! No need to worry while traveling, your reminders are always on time.
REFILL REMINDER: Rx refill reminds you when you need to restock your prescriptions.
PRN FRIENDLY: List PRN (on demand) medication.

Whether you are taking one drug dosage or more, you know how difficult it is remembering each pill right on time. If you are a caretaker for a child, parent, or patient suffering from chronic pain or illness, you know how stressful it is not knowing for sure if your loved one took their medications correctly.

Medisafe does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding your medications or a medical condition.
