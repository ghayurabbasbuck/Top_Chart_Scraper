Each week you'll have a personalized meal plan with simple & healthy recipes that are catered to your exact needs and preferences.

Eliminate decision fatigue after a long day's work - simply pick a recipe from your meal plan and cook it in less time than it takes to pick up an unhealthy (and expensive) takeout meal.

With the most personalization options of any minimal-waste meal planner out there, you can cook exactly how you want to eat.

From classic, flexitarian, pescetarian, low carb, paleo, keto, vegetarian & vegan diet types to gluten free, dairy free, and a dozen more restrictions, and hundreds of individual dislikable ingredients, your meal plans will be truly personalized to your specific needs.

4. SUPER FAST GROCERY LIST & EFFORTLESS GROCERY DELIVERY
When you build a new meal plan, a grocery list of all the ingredients you'll need for the week is automatically created. Simply grab your iPhone and shop in-store or get your grocery shopping done from your phone in minutes. Mealime works with most leading grocery retailers and we're always adding more!

5. SAVE MONEY WITH MINIMAL FOOD WASTE
It's annoying when you purchase ingredients from the grocery store, cook a meal or two, and have a bunch of ingredients going bad by the end of the week, isn't it?

With Mealime, your days of wasting food are over! All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible, saving you hundreds of dollars per year.

6. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR NUTRITION GOALS

You can prepare the shopping lists at home and then in the store enter the amount (unit price) next to each item. The app calculates on the fly the total, even when multiple entries are set for the same item.

The pro version can be unlocked via an In App Purchase.
Pro features;
- Unlimited entries
- A clear button to clear all the check marks, units, promotions and prices in each shopping list, so you can reuse the list
- Two more app icons, dark mode and gold
- Calculator, use it without leaving the app

Advantages: 
- You can budget your shoppings, create multiple lists
- You can budget per shopping list, for even better control
- You can compare the bill from the store with what you have tracked
- You can see if the promotions are correctly billed (long press before the checkmark box to mark it)
- You can store the list in the photo roll, it has a date, so you can see later if items you buy regularly have increased in price. You can also sort the list before saving for better comparison with the real store receipt.
- In some stores you get discounts above a certain total or each x amount, now you can see in the store if you have reached this amount
- You can copy lists, so you don't have to retype so much
- You can see where you spent the most money on with, Where's my money?

Some budget tips;

You can give the main page title the name of the month and enter a global budget for this month. Then create shopping lists per store per week. For Example;

Walmart-week1
Walmart-week2
Walmart-week3
Walmart-week4

If you don't want to track the price of each article, you can still monitor your budget progress by giving the first item the total price of the receipt.
