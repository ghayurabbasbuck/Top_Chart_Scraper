The app includes a tool life prediction calculator using the Taylor equation, so you can plan tool changes better. It can estimate cost per part by combining tooling cost and machine time. You also get tool life per edge or per corner to track insert usage more clearly. For quality control, CNCFeedWizard offers a simple surface finish estimator for turning and milling. It even handles radial chip thinning and spindle power needs, so your feeds and speeds stay safe, efficient, and easy to set.",2025-11-19T08:00:00Z,2025-11-19T13:07:15Z
