About the New International Version (NIV):

The NIV Bible is…

Accurate.
The NIV translators are united by their conviction that the Bible is God’s inspired Word. That, along with their individual expertise and years of studying biblical languages, helps them to capture subtle nuances and the depth of meaning in the Bible.

Readable.
The NIV text has been carefully and thoughtfully designed to provide the best reading experience possible. Each phrase has been purposefully crafted with the end user in mind, and the NIV’s 8th- grade reading level makes it accessible to most English readers around the world. 

Clear.
The Bible should be every bit as clear to you as it was to its original audience. The NIV translators take great care to balance accuracy, readability, and clarity using global English as it is spoken today.

Beautiful.
The NIV translators also prioritize literary beauty, resulting in a Bible translation that’s suitable for both private and public reading.

Trustworthy.
The NIV is translated by an independent, self-governing team of Bible scholars using the oldest and most reliable Bible manuscripts available today. No publisher, ministry, or other group can tell the committee how to translate God’s Word and there are safeguards in place to avoid theological bias. 

App Features:
