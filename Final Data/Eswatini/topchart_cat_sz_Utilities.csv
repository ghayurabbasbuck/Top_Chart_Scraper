Cleanup makes cleaning simple, fun, and safe.

Smart cleaning, effortless decision-making
Swipe left to delete unnecessary or duplicate photos, and swipe right to keep precious moments.
You'll find so many unnecessary photos in the album!

Keep only the best photos
The cleanup feature intelligently recommends which photo to keep among multiple similar ones
For example, if you smile directly at the camera, the image is clear, or if you have previously edited or saved the photo
Of course, the final decision always rests with you. We will never delete any photos without your permission.

Double Confirmation Mechanism to Prevent Accidental Deletion
Just like the ""Recycle Bin"" on a computer, we will seek your final confirmation before deletion,
Completely eliminate the risk of accidental deletion.

Efficient cleaning, also healing the mood
We know the opponent could be a cat video or a puzzle game
However, Cleanup allows you to maintain a tidy photo album after brief usage—
Not just a sense of guilt for wasting time.

Local operation, 100% privacy security
Cleaning can operate without an internet connection, and all processing is completed locally on the mobile device.
Even if we wanted to, we couldn't misuse your photos. :)

Sort videos by size
Easily find and prioritize deleting videos that occupy the most space,
For example, a ""memory package"" that has been accumulating for a long time and occupies 2GB.

Every family's relationship with technology is unique, so we have built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings and more.


With Family Link, you can:

Establish digital ground rules
• Set screen time limits – find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so that you can help your child find a healthy balance.
• Manage your child's apps – give your child the flexibility that they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.

Manage content filters and security and privacy
• Manage what they see online – set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites and more.
• Secure their account – Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child's password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel that it's necessary.*

*Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.

Stay connected on the go
• See where they are – it's helpful to be able to find your family when they're on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they're carrying their device.
• Get notifications and alerts – Family Link delivers critical notifications, including when your child arrives at or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device's remaining battery life.


Important information

• Family Link's tools vary depending on your child's device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps that you have previously approved or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will only apply when your child makes a purchase through Google Play's billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternative billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child's installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
• You should carefully review the apps on your child's supervised device and disable those that you don't want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
• To see the location of your child or teenager's device, the device must be turned on, recently active and connected to the Internet through data or Wi-Fi.
• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google Accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child's online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the Internet safe. Family Link cannot determine the content on the Internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device and determine what path to online safety looks best for their family.",2018-09-23T16:36:46Z,2025-11-20T00:20:39Z
