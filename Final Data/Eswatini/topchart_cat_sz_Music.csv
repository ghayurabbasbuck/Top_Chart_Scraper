Clear Wave is your all-in-one audio utility, designed to generate pure wave tones between 50 Hz and 30,000 Hz and monitor environmental noise levels using a professional-grade dB meter.

Swipe your finger clockwise or anti-clockwise to adjust the tone frequency. Take full control of volume, waveform, and frequency in real time. The app includes a wide range of waveforms such as sine, square, triangle, saw up, and saw down.

Using carefully tuned frequencies, Water Eject helps to remove trapped moisture from your device’s speakers after exposure to water – whether from rain, a splash, or a spill. With just one tap, Water Eject vibrates water out of the speaker grille to help restore crisp sound.

In addition to Water Eject, Clear Wave includes an intelligent Speaker Cleaner mode. This mode emits high-frequency pulses to dislodge dirt, dust, and debris – keeping your speaker in optimal condition. Regular use of the Speaker Cleaner ensures you enjoy maximum audio clarity.

The integrated dB meter allows you to track ambient noise in real time. This helps prevent long-term hearing damage and is perfect for professionals who need accurate sound measurements.

You can also take photos with overlays showing dB levels, date, and time – ideal for reports and monitoring.
