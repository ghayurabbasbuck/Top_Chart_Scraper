The Bible consists of two parts:

Old Testament
The Old Testament tells the story of how God created the world and the first people — Adam and Eve. This part of the Bible includes many stories from the lives of the ancient Hebrews: how the patriarchs lived in the lands of the Middle East, raising their flocks; how the descendants of Abraham were enslaved in Egypt and later freed by God; how the people made a covenant with the Lord on Mount Sinai and received the Ten Commandments; and how God promised to lead His people to the Promised Land.

New Testament
The New Testament tells the story of the earthly life of Jesus Christ — from His miraculous birth to His crucifixion and glorious Resurrection. In this part of the Bible, you will find stories about Jesus’ ministry, His parables and miracles, the Last Supper, His suffering, death on the cross, and Resurrection. The New Testament also describes the beginnings of the early Christian communities, the deeds of the apostles, and the letters written by Christ’s followers to believers around the world.

The Holy Bible is a collection of diverse texts — myths, legends, prayers, historical narratives, and prophecies. Many biblical stories need explanation for modern children, so our audio Bible retells them in simple and clear language.

Believe in God and Jesus Christ, grow in faith, live with love, and listen to these Bible audio stories together with your children.",2022-02-01T08:00:00Z,2025-11-17T17:41:26Z
