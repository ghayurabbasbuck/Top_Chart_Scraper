Biblia ya Kikristo ni mkusanyo wa maandiko matakatifu ya Ukristo. Maandiko hayo mbalimbali yanaitwa tangu zamani sana ""vitabu"" tu, inavyomaanishwa na neno ""biblia"" ambalo ni uwingi wa neno la Kigiriki ""biblos"" yaani ""kitabu"".
Hutofautishwa na Tanakh ambayo ndiyo maandiko matakatifu ya dini ya Uyahudi na ambayo pengine inatajwa kwa jina lilelile la ""Biblia"", hasa katika matoleo ya Biblia ya Kiebrania . Vitabu vyake vimo katika sehemu ya kwanza ya Biblia ya Kikristo kwa jina la ""Agano la Kale"".
Biblia ya Kikristo hugawiwa sehemu mbili ambayo ni Agano la Kale na Agano Jipya. Agano la Kale lina maandiko yaliyoandikwa kabla ya Yesu Kristo na vitabu vya Agano Jipya viliandikwa baada yake.
Agano la Kale
Kimsingi vitabu vya Agano la Kale ni vilevile vya Biblia ya Kiebrania, ingawa madhehebu ya Kikristo hutofautiana kidogo katika hilo. Ni kwamba wakati wa kutokea kwa Ukristo palikuwa na tofauti ndani ya Uyahudi kuhusu vitabu vilivyohesabiwa kuwa maandiko matakatifu. Suala hilo liliondolewa kuanzia mwaka 80 BK wataalamu wa Wayahudi wa huko Jabneh (Jamnia) walipochukua msimamo mkali dhidi ya wafuasi wa Yesu.
Kwa wakati huo Wakristo walikuwa wamezoea tayari toleo la Kigiriki la maandiko matakatifu yaliyotafsiriwa katika karne ya 2 KK ambalo linajulikana kwa jina la Septuaginta na kuwa na vitabu kadhaa visivyokuwa vimetunzwa katika lugha asili ya Kiebrania wala ya Kiaramu, au vilivyoandikwa moja kwa moja katika lugha ya Kigiriki.
Hivyo Biblia ya Kikristo ilikuwa na vitabu 7 (viwili vya Wamakabayo, Yoshua bin Sira, Hekima, Tobiti, Yudith na Baruku, pamoja na sehemu za Esta na Danieli) visivyokubaliwa baadaye na Wayahudi.
Vitabu hivyo 7 vikaja kukataliwa na Martin Luther katika karne ya 16, halafu na Waprotestanti wengi, lakini vinazidi kutumiwa na Kanisa Katoliki na Waorthodoksi kwa jina la Deuterokanoni.
Agano Jipya
Kuna vitabu 27 vya Agano Jipya. Vinne vya kwanza ni Injili nne zinazoleta habari za maisha, matendo na maneno ya Yesu.
Vingine ni Matendo ya Mitume, Nyaraka za Mitume, hasa Mtume Paulo, na Ufunuo wa Yohane.",2015-04-06T19:24:59Z,2023-01-30T18:55:33Z
