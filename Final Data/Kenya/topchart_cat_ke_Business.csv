Review from eCommerce News HQ
“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“
(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)

Review from David B via g2.com
“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”

Our network of 150+ agents ensures your customers can collect their package at their convenience from an agent near them.

Simply fill out all the necessary details on the relevant delivery form and pay for the delivery fee using the app via M-Pesa. Afterwards, you can track your package as it moves from the sending agent to the warehouse for sorting before it reaches your customer. You will receive notifications on the status of your package as it moves through the journey.

Does your customer have a pending payment for a package? No worries, because they can pay for it through the application once a rider delivers their package or when they collect it from one of our agents.

Would you like your products to be stocked in the Nairobi CBD? You can rent as much shelf space as you need and manage your inventory through the shelf stock service in our application.

And after making enough sales, you can withdraw your revenue directly through your wallet on the app. Awesome, right?

You can also track your business' statistics on the sales analytics and home pages to obtain crucial data points that can help you improve your sales!
