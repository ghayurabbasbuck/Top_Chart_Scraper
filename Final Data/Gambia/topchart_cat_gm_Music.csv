This app presents the full recitation of Sheikh Khalil Al-Khusairi, one of Egypt’s renowned Qur’an reciters, together with a collection of practical Islamic tools designed to support your daily worship.

Main Features
	•	Qur’an Audio
	•	Listen offline in a lightweight, space-saving audio version.
	•	Enjoy high-quality streaming whenever you are connected to the internet.
	•	Save individual Surahs for offline listening in high quality – download only what you need and remove them later to free space.
	•	Prayer Times
	•	Accurate local prayer times.
	•	Adhan alerts and smart notifications for every prayer.
	•	Daily Adhkar
	•	Morning, evening, and daily adhkar collections.

Why This Update Matters

Earlier versions required more space to keep all recitations offline in full quality, which made it difficult for many users to install or update.
Now the app is smaller and faster while still giving you every listening choice you need:
	•	Offline playback in light audio by default.
	•	High-quality streaming online.
	•	The ability to save any Surah you wish in high quality for offline use.

You also get prayer-time notifications, adhkar reminders, and a refreshed, modern design.
