CHANGE THE TIME
In the settings, you can switch between ‘Your time’ and ‘Local time.’ To switch between them, click the ‘Your time’ and ‘Local time’ options on the clock's hour section.

ADD LOCATION ON APPLE WATCH
It’s handy to know that the first location added to your list is set as the location on your Apple Watch. To edit or change this, you can reorder the cities in your location overview on your iPhone.

CHANGE MY BACKGROUND VIDEO
Unfortunately, you can’t manually select a video to play as a background. The app selects a random video from a pool of weather videos that match the weather for the report you’re currently viewing.
You can expand this pool of videos by unlocking videos in the menu screen, which is done by watching a short ad per video.
