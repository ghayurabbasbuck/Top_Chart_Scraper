Suitable for beginners.

What is Namaz?
Namaz is the daily muslim prayer, also known as Salat or Salah. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and the best way of worshipping Allah the Almighty.

Description:
This app is an audio player for you to listen to the correct pronunciation of the prayers in Arabic. It will help you to learn the dua-invocations and parts of the Quran that are read inside the prayer. You will also have the texts in English transliteration and some illustrations to help you navigate through the process. All content is in accordance with the rules of the Hanafi school of law.

Important to understand, that this is a companion app, and it is not sufficient to fully learn the prayer on its own. We also strongly recommend that you learn to read Arabic, as English letters and phonemes are not sufficient to convey all sounds found in Arabic. Learning to read Arabic will allow you to perform your prayers in the best way and will give you access to the Holy Quran. The easiest and most effective way to learn both prayer and reading Arabic is to find a good teacher.

FEATURE SET: 

- NIGHT SKY + AURA (Night Sky + Aura Subscription required) - Your Personal AI Super Astronomer!  Ask Night Sky Aura virtually anything about Space and it will know the answer.

With your own personal AI Super Astronomer right by your side, Night Sky Aura becomes the new natural way to interact with the sky above!

You can even add Astrophotography photos and observation notes to your Sky Tags!
