Review from eCommerce News HQ
“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“

“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”

I made this app as a prototype for a larger app I was working on, to my delight my kids LOVED it. They use this whenever they want to draw instead of the other drawing apps we already had.

* Undo, Redo, and Clear drawing actions
* Special ""Rainbow"" marker lets you draw with a rainbow!!! you gotta try it!
* Change the background color by long pressing on one of the colors
* Remembers your last used marker color and size and your canvas color.
* Import photos to trace, annotate, and have fun with
* Shake to erase
* Save your drawings to your Photos library
* Print your drawings to AirPrint enabled printers
* Share your drawings with Messages, Mail, and many more
* Creator Kit allows you to provide financial support for development of Whiteboard.

Whiteboard Labs Features (early stage features you can opt-in to try)
* Draw with Knobs - draw pictures using knobs the old school way!
* Screen Recording - record the screen and audio as you draw, save or send the recording to friends and family.
* Draw with Motion - tilt your device to draw a picture

My goal is to make the funnest and easiest to use drawing app for kids. I improve Whiteboard with your reviews, feedback, and financial support. If you or someone you know, enjoys using Whiteboard:
