【Description of Auto-Renewal Service (Subscription)】
1.If you have activated this auto-renewal service through Apple ID and do not actively cancel it within the subscription period, Apple will automatically deduct the service fee for the next subscription period from the balance of the Apple ID account (hereinafter referred to as ""Account"") bound to the auto-renewal service 24 hours before the expiration of each subscription period, thereby extending the membership validity period corresponding to the subscription period (subject to Apple's actual deduction rules). You should monitor the balance status of the above account. If the renewal fails due to account issues or insufficient balance, you will bear the risks and/or losses. To help you understand the auto-renewal situation, Apple will notify you of the upcoming deduction five days in advance via [in-site messages or emails], so please pay attention to receiving them. Please note that due to the nature of the auto-renewal service, if you do not explicitly cancel the auto-renewal service within the subscription period, Apple will issue a deduction instruction for the next subscription period based on your authorization. In principle, the fees deducted based on this instruction will not be refunded.
2.Subscription period: 1 month, 1 year, etc. (subject to the subscription page settings), which you can choose by yourself.
3.You acknowledge and agree that iCSee has the right to adjust the service price or stop providing the auto-renewal service. If iCSee adjusts the service price when you activate the auto-renewal service, you will be notified in advance in an appropriate manner (including but not limited to in-site announcements, SMS, etc.). If you do not agree to the service price adjustment, you can cancel the auto-renewal service according to these rules. If you do not cancel the auto-renewal service, the subsequent fees deducted by Apple will be based on the adjusted service fees. If you cancel within 24 hours before the subscription period expires, Apple may deduct the service fee for the next subscription period according to the adjusted service fees before stopping the deduction service. After the auto-renewal service is canceled, if you reactivate the auto-renewal service, the service fee automatically deducted by Apple will be based on the service fee displayed on the page at that time.
4.The method to unsubscribe from the auto-renewal service is as follows:
Open the Apple iOS device ""App Store"" -> click on the Apple account avatar in the top right corner -> enter ""Account"" -> click ""Subscriptions"" -> select ""iCSee"", and cancel the subscription.
