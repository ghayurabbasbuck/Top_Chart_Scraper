La Biblia, que es, los sacros libros del Viejo y Nuevo Testamento. Trasladada en español. La Palabra del Dios nuestro permanece para siempre. 1569, también conocida como la Biblia del Oso, es la primera traducción completa de la Biblia al español, publicada el 28 de septiembre de 1569. Su traductor fue Casiodoro de Reina. La Biblia del Oso es usualmente referida como Reina-Valera (RV) por haber hecho Cipriano de Valera la primera revisión de ella en 1602.
La Reina-Valera tuvo amplia difusión durante la Reforma Protestante del siglo XVI. Hoy en día, la Reina-Valera (con varias revisiones a través de los años) es una de las biblias en español más usadas por gran parte de las iglesias cristianas derivadas de la Reforma (incluyendo las iglesias evangélicas), así como por otros grupos de fe cristiana, como la Iglesia Adventista del Séptimo Día, La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días, los Gedeones Internacionales y otros cristianos no denominacionales.
Traducción de Reina
Casiodoro de Reina, monje jerónimo español del Monasterio de San Isidoro del Campo, tras partir al exilio para escapar de las persecuciones de la Inquisición, trabajó durante doce años en la traducción de la Biblia. La Biblia del Oso fue publicada en Basilea, Suiza. Es llamada Biblia del Oso por la ilustración en su portada de un oso que intenta alcanzar un panal de miel colgado de un árbol. Se colocó esa ilustración, logotipo del impresor bávaro Mattias Apiarius, en la portada para evitar el uso de íconos religiosos, porque en aquel tiempo estaba prohibida cualquier traducción de la Biblia a lenguas vernáculas.
La traducción del Antiguo Testamento, como lo declara expresamente Casiodoro de Reina en su “Amonestación del intérprete de los sacros libros al lector”, se basó en el texto masorético hebreo (edición de Bomberg, 1525). Como consideraba que la Vulgata latina ya había cumplido su papel y contenía errores y cambios, prefirió usar como fuente secundaria la traducción al latín de Sanctes Pagnino (Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio, 1528), porque “al voto de todos los doctos en la lengua hebraica es tenida por la más pura que hasta ahora hay”, corrigiendo la versión masorética cada vez que se aparta de las citas del Antiguo en el Nuevo Testamento. Tuvo siempre a mano para resolver las dudas la Biblia de Ferrara (Abraham Usque y Yom-Tob Athias, 1553), traducción del hebreo al judeoespañol usada por los judíos sefardíes, que Reina consideraba “obra de la mayor estima”, “por dar la natural y primera significación de los vocablos hebreos y las diferencias de los tiempos de los verbos”.
Para la traducción del Nuevo Testamento, Reina se basó en el Textus Receptus (Erasmo 1516, Stephanus, 1550), en la Políglota Complutense y en los mejores manuscritos griegos que en ese tiempo se conocían. Al parecer, tenía a la vista las versiones del Nuevo Testamento de Juan Pérez de Pineda de 1556, Francisco de Enzinas de 1543 y traducciones de Juan de Valdés.",2016-07-08T19:01:11Z,2025-06-09T06:20:36Z

Novel Effect was featured on Shark Tank, The TODAY Show, and in Forbes, Variety, Lifehacker, and more.

“I felt like a real audiobook narrator. My five-year-old tried reading a book on her own… and amazingly, the system picked up her little voice and played the effects at all the right moments.” - Michelle Woo, Lifehacker

""Not only did this tool help make poetry come alive for [my student], he asked me if he could try reading... I about fell out of my chair because he never wants to read aloud... and he has asked to go to the library to check out books that he can read along with the app."" - Julie Smith, The Techie Teacher®

""I think this is cool as cool can be… I love it, I love it!"" - Lori Greiner, entrepreneur and investor on ABC’s Shark Tank

Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur. This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

The text consists of 1430 angs (pages) and 6,000 shabads (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music. The bulk of the scripture is divided into thirty-one ragas, with each Granth raga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the ragas in which they are read. The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, in various languages, including Lahnda (Western Punjabi), Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Persian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.

Guru Granth Sahib was composed by seven Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Gobind Singh added 1 sloakh in mahala 9 Ang 1429. It also contains the traditions and teachings of Indian sants (saints), such as Ravidas, Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and two Muslim Sufi saints Bhagat Bhikan and Sheikh Farid.

The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind.",2018-03-15T04:35:39Z,2024-02-19T16:52:25Z
