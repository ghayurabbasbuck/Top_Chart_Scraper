Our meal plans & recipes are highly customizable so you can easily personalize a plan that works with your unique tastes and lifestyle.

Join over 5,000,000 people who have used our meal plans to eat healthier, reduce stress, lose weight, save money, and live happier, more productive lives.

Check out our top benefits and features:

1. COOK HEALTHY MEALS IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES OR LESS
We've reimagined and streamlined the cooking experience. Prepare meals quickly with our step-by-step and hassle-free cooking instructions.

You'll never again have to jump around looking for an ingredient, instruction, or piece of cookware that you may have overlooked. 

2. NO MORE STRESSFUL ""WHAT SHOULD I EAT?"" DECISIONS TO MAKE
Each week you'll have a personalized meal plan with simple & healthy recipes that are catered to your exact needs and preferences.

Eliminate decision fatigue after a long day's work - simply pick a recipe from your meal plan and cook it in less time than it takes to pick up an unhealthy (and expensive) takeout meal.

3. HEALTHY MEAL PLANS THAT ARE UNIQUELY YOUR OWN
With the most personalization options of any minimal-waste meal planner out there, you can cook exactly how you want to eat.

From classic, flexitarian, pescetarian, low carb, paleo, keto, vegetarian & vegan diet types to gluten free, dairy free, and a dozen more restrictions, and hundreds of individual dislikable ingredients, your meal plans will be truly personalized to your specific needs.

4. SUPER FAST GROCERY LIST & EFFORTLESS GROCERY DELIVERY
When you build a new meal plan, a grocery list of all the ingredients you'll need for the week is automatically created. Simply grab your iPhone and shop in-store or get your grocery shopping done from your phone in minutes. Mealime works with most leading grocery retailers and we're always adding more!

5. SAVE MONEY WITH MINIMAL FOOD WASTE
It's annoying when you purchase ingredients from the grocery store, cook a meal or two, and have a bunch of ingredients going bad by the end of the week, isn't it?

With Mealime, your days of wasting food are over! All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible, saving you hundreds of dollars per year.

6. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR NUTRITION GOALS
Every Mealime recipe lists comprehensive nutrition information so you can easily see what you're eating. Mealime integrates with the Health app so that you can easily see all of your health information in one place!

MEAL PLANNER PRO SUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS
Mealime is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade to Mealime Meal Planner Pro, we offer two auto-renewing subscription options - one at a price of £2.99 / month.

Payment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. There is no increase in price when renewing.
