Установите «Номерограм». Введите в поиск гос номер, и мы найдём вам историю продажи машины или отдельные её фото из Интернета. Покажем даты размещения объявления, цену и пробег.

В нашей базе свыше 25 000 000 номеров. Фотографии в «Номерограм» приходят как от людей (можно добавить фото машины с гос номером через приложение), так и с досок объявлений, социальных сетей и других сайтов. Всё из открытых источников.

«Номерограм» найдёт для вас по гос номеру:

Пробег автомобиля.

Если автомобиль ранее размещался на авито, автору, дром и т.д., мы найдём его фотографии и покажем пробег, который указал продавец в объявлении. Наша база непрерывно пополняется. 

Цена машины.

Также мы сможем показать вам цену машины. А если она продавалась несколько раз, то вы сможете увидеть историю изменения цены. Это полезная информация, которая поможет вам поторговаться.

Город продажи.

Мы можем находить не только пробеги и цены, но и города продажи автомобиля. Всегда интересно узнать, где бегала машина ранее. 

Фото ДТП и ремонтов.

«Номерограм» мониторит не только доски объявлений, но и другие ресурсы. Поиск по номеру может помочь вам увидеть фото ДТП или процесс ремонта автомобиля.

Ещё вы можете по фото выяснить, что машина бегала в такси.

Несколько показательных примеров:

Скрутил 100 000 километров пробега — А 774 СО 716
Жёсткое ДТП, машину восстановили — А 714 НТ 38
Была в ДТП и работала в такси — Т 146 УС 56
Бесславный конец японской гонки — О 461 ЕА 125

И это не всё!

Мы хотим сделать мир лучше и помочь покупателям подержанных машин. Всё-таки приятно подстраховать себя перед покупкой авто, а не играть в лотерею. Для этого «Номерограм» и сделан.
