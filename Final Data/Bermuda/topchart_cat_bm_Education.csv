WE DO LANGUAGE LEARNING LIKE NO ONE ELSE

We take you to the heart of the language you're passionate about and give you everything you need to understand the language and the culture like a local.


Each full level has:
• Over 60 hours of Audio lessons
• Over 60 hours of Language & Culture lessons
• Plenty of Writing lessons (script languages only)
• Voice Recognition that lets you perfect your pronunciation on the thousands of phrases in every course
• 24/7 lifetime access with free upgrades
• All of your progress is synchronized across all of your devices

HAVE LIFETIME ACCESS TO YOUR COURSE.
A new language can be yours for life, and we believe your language course should be too. With Rocket Languages, you can come back in a month, a year or even a decade and still have full access to your courses. You'll also get all of the updates and improvements that we make for free!

PERFECT YOUR PRONUNCIATION.
If you can pronounce words correctly, then you know you'll be understood by the locals - which is why we teach you to talk just like they do. With our courses, you can check your pronunciation using our state-of-the-art voice recognition system and to native speaker audio of thousands of useful words and phrases.

PRACTICE ON-THE-SPOT SPEAKING.
Many new language learners feel nervous about talking to native speakers, so we've created the perfect activity to address this problem. It lets you practice both sides of common conversations in a comfortable, stress-free environment, so that you're ready to respond when you're out in the real world.

LESSON LIST
Remember what you cover.
You'll put a lot of time into learning your new language, so we make sure you can remember it all by including fun and engaging activities in every lesson. These activities use algorithms to identify where you're having trouble and help you practice problematic words and phrases until they stick.

LEARN HOW THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY WORKS.
Knowing a few set phrases in your new language can be helpful, but will only get you so far in real-life situations. We take you step by step through how the language works so that you can build sentences on your own and actually take part in conversations.

TRAIN YOUR EARS AS WELL AS YOUR MOUTH.
When you first hear someone speak in a language you don't know, it can be hard to make out even a single word. Our courses come with tons of downloadable audio tracks that train your ear to your new language.

BE READY TO BLEND IN WITH THE LOCALS.
Communicating and connecting with people in another language isn't just about using proper grammar - it's also about understanding another culture. We get you ready for this with lessons on everything from greetings and foods to holidays and local customs.

GET COURSES TAILORED FOR YOUR NEW LANGUAGE.
A lot of other courses out there take a cookie-cutter approach, using the same template for every language they teach. At Rocket Languages, we understand that no two languages are exactly alike! That's why we've carefully crafted each of our courses to include what's practical, relevant, and useful for the language you are learning.

STAY ON TRACK AND STAY INSPIRED.
Motivation is key to learning a language, so we make sure to provide you with a wide array of motivational tools and techniques. They'll keep your interest up and your focus sharp so you can meet your goals and make better progress.",2013-02-21T20:31:09Z,2025-09-12T22:40:28Z

You can create and dress up dolls, build and design your dream house, simulate daily life in a bustling city, and embark on thrilling adventures in tons of fantasy worlds.

DRESS UP YOUR DOLL
Design a variety of dolls for your story! Create endless combinations of body shapes, facial features, and hairstyles, then apply stunning makeup to your doll – can you create the perfect look? Select from hundreds of types of clothes, accessories, and shoes to style your unique doll. Express your personality with different outfits. Pink fashion? Princess style? Y2K? Gothic? K-POP? Or design a brand-new style! You can create original designs, explore color combinations, and showcase your design talent.

ROLE PLAYING
Everyone in Aha World is under your control! Choose your dolls' expressions, give them a voice, make them move and dance, and (if you dare) make them fart! Give each a unique personality and tell their story your way. You can play the role of a doctor in the baby care center, a police officer chasing bad guys, a pop superstar, or a beautiful princess. If you find daily life too dull, transform into a warrior to battle dragons, embark on an adventure in the icy Polar Regions, or explore treasures in the mysterious depths of the sea. The only limit is your imagination.

DESIGN YOUR HOME
What is your dream home? A pink princess apartment, an outdoor RV, or a spacious villa with a swimming pool? You can enjoy a single life with friends or choose to start a large family, take care of a baby, and raise a dog. Now, it’s time to unleash your inner designer and select from over 3000 furniture items – you can also DIY design furniture that is 100% unique to you and your home. After you design and decorate your home and fill it with your dolls, don't forget to invite your friends to the party!
