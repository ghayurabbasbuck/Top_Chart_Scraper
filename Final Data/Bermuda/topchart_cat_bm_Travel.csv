JET LAG MYTHS VS. CIRCADIAN SCIENCE

Misleading advice on conquering jet lag — often promoted by non-experts — not only fails to help travelers but can make jet lag symptoms worse and may even cause harm.

It’s time to replace the myths with real science.

Generic sleep advice, exercise, hydration, grounding, dietary supplements, special diets, or fasting won’t solve jet lag because they don’t ""reset"" your circadian clock to new time zones.

THE REAL JET LAG SCIENCE

// In your brain, a circadian clock helps manage the regular rhythm of your day.
// Jet lag is caused when your sleep/wake and light/dark cycles shift too quickly for your circadian clock to keep up.
//  Light is the key time cue to “reset” your circadian clock, so the correct timing of light exposure and avoidance is the only way to adjust to new time zones quickly. If your timing is wrong, it will make your jet lag worse.

WHY WE MADE TIMESHIFTER

Getting the timing right is both complex and unintuitive. We created Timeshifter to make circadian science accessible and help you apply it to conquer jet lag.

Timeshifter helps you tackle both the underlying cause of jet lag – the disruption of your circadian clock – as well as reduce the disruptive symptoms, such as insomnia, sleepiness and digestive discomfort.

KEY FEATURES

// Circadian Time™: Advice is based on your body’s clock
// Practicality Filter™: Adjusts advice to the ""real world""
// Quick Turnaround®: Automatically detects short trips
// Pre-travel advice: Start adjusting before departure
// Push notifications: View advice without opening the app

PROVEN RESULTS

Based on ~130,000 post-flight surveys:
// 96.4% of users who followed Timeshifter's advice 80% or more did not struggle with severe or very severe jet lag.
// Travelers who did not follow the advice experienced a 6.2x increase in severe or very severe jet lag, and a 14.1x increase in very severe jet lag!

Simply complete your travel information, answer CBP inspection questions, capture a photo of yourself and of each member of your group, and follow the instructions provided on your receipt. 

Important Notes:
• MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will still be required for travel.
• MPC is only available at supported CBP entry locations.
• MPC is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens, certain Canadian Citizen Visitors, Lawful Permanent Residents, and returning Visa Waiver Program applicants with an approved ESTA.

More information regarding eligibility and supported CBP entry locations can be found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control


MPC can be used in 6 simple steps:

1.  Create a primary profile to save your travel documents and biographic information. You can add and save additional eligible people to the MPC app so that you can submit together from one device. Your information will be securely stored on your device to be used for future travel.

2. Select your CBP port of entry, terminal (if applicable), and add up to 11 additional members of your group to include in your submission.

3. Answer CBP inspection questions and certify the truthfulness and accuracy of your answers.

4. Upon arriving at your selected port of entry, tap the “Yes, Submit Now” button. You will be asked to capture a clear and unobstructed photo of yourself and of each other person that you included in your submission.

5. Once your submission is processed, CBP will send a virtual receipt back to your device. Follow the instructions on your receipt and be prepared to present your passport and other relevant travel documents.

6. The CBP Officer will complete the inspection. If further information is required, the CBP Officer will let you know. Please note: The CBP Officer may ask to capture an additional photo of you or your group members for verification.",2021-05-11T07:00:00Z,2025-10-10T17:13:52Z
