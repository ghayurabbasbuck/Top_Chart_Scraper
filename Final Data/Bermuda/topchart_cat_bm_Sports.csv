The SuperSpeed Golf App brings the most comprehensive speed training program into a convenient app for you to work on your golf game wherever you are. From overspeed training, to ground reaction force training, to fitness and mobility, the SuperSpeed Golf App is your hub for longer drives.

3x Major Champion, Padraig Harrington, calls SuperSpeed Golf, ""The easiest way to gain speed.""

The SuperSpeed Golf App includes:

THE SUPERSPEED DIFFERENCE
SuperSpeed Golf stands out in the speed training market because of key differentiators in our programs such as:
- Our system is specifically designed to not mess up your swing mechanics because of the precision weighting of our clubs.
- We always include non-dominant swings, because data has shown that working both sides of the body greatly improves the dominant side than just working the dominant side only.
- Results are driven by how your speed translates to the actual golf course with your own clubs.
- Our protocols only take about 15 minutes to complete.
- We utilize a 3 club set so you can easily move between clubs without wasting unnecessary time fiddling with weights and prolonging your rest periods which gets you out of rhythm.

COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS
The SuperSpeed complete training program includes:
- Training and pre-round style warm ups
- Overspeed training
- Counterweight Training
- Ground Reaction Force for Force Board Pro and Force Pedals
- Balance and Stability with PGA Tour Trainer, Jason Glass
- Rotational Sequencing
- Wrist Mechanics
- Fitness and Mobility with PGA Tour Trainer, Jason Glass
