*From the team at ORIGINATOR - the creators of the beloved Endless Alphabet and Sesame Street's Monster at the End of This Book and Another Monster....  Originator is a team of passionate artists and engineers dedicated to the best education+entertainment apps for kids.*

As a follow-up to Endless Alphabet, set the stage for early reading success with Endless Reader!  This app introduces ""sight words"", the most commonly used words in school, library, and children's books.  Kids need to recognize these words by sight in order to achieve reading fluency.  Recognizing sight words is advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling, cannot be sounded out using phonics knowledge, and often cannot be represented using pictures. 

Kids will have a blast learning sight words and their context and usage with the adorable Endless monsters.  Each word features an interactive word puzzle with letters that come alive, and then a sentence puzzle with words that become what they describe.  See the word ""dog"" as a barking dog, and the word ""up"" reach for the sky!

** NOTE: You must be online and have sufficient disk space while running the app to get all words in the app. **

Features:
- 6 words free to try with additional word packs available for purchase.
- Delightful animations reinforce sight recognition of words in a fun and interactive way.
- Word puzzles reinforce spelling using lower-case letters and the sentence puzzles teach definition and usage (in addition to sight recognition).
- 3D Touch on iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus makes letters and words react in an extra special way!
- Endless Reader was designed with your children in mind.  There are no high scores, failures, limits or stress.  Your children can interact with the app at their own pace.",2013-11-21T04:30:51Z,2022-08-11T20:02:07Z

Speak, write, and read Chinese with ease.

Learning Chinese and passing the HSK exam might sound intimidating. But with Chinesimple and our fearless tutor Bingo, you'll get there faster — and have a good time doing it.

WHY CHOOSE CHINESIMPLE – YOUR ALL-IN-ONE CHINESE LEARNING APP

We didn’t just slap together a phrasebook. Chinesimple includes a complete learning path with hundreds of structured lessons. Who else offers that? Exactly.

• LEARN TO WRITE — FOR REAL
Our stroke animations were drawn by actual people, not generated by some fancy AI. Each stroke reflects real handwriting from a native speaker. Because learning how to write Chinese means actually learning how it’s written.

• FLASHCARDS, BUT DONE RIGHT
Every HSK word comes with a flashcard and an image. More than 6,000, all designed to make vocabulary stick. Are we obsessed? A little. But it works.

• MASTER USEFUL CHINESE SENTENCES
Over 4,000 real-life examples — with native audio recorded by the same person who drew all the strokes. Offline. Data-free. Airplane-mode ready.

• SPEAK CHINESE IN REAL CONTEXTS
Practice everyday phrases and build confidence with voice recognition and listening tools that actually help.

• 100% PERSONALIZED LEARNING
Choose what you want to focus on — pronunciation, reading, writing — and we’ll tailor the content to your goals. No pressure, just progress.

• LEARNING THAT’S ACTUALLY FUN
Score points. Unlock challenges. Hit goals. This isn’t gamification as a gimmick — it’s motivation that works.

• CHARACTERS FOR EVERY REGION
Learn both simplified and traditional Chinese characters, so you’re ready for anything — from Beijing to Taipei.
