Suitable for beginners.

What is Namaz?
Namaz is the daily muslim prayer, also known as Salat or Salah. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and the best way of worshipping Allah the Almighty.

Description:
This app is an audio player for you to listen to the correct pronunciation of the prayers in Arabic. It will help you to learn the dua-invocations and parts of the Quran that are read inside the prayer. You will also have the texts in English transliteration and some illustrations to help you navigate through the process. All content is in accordance with the rules of the Hanafi school of law.

Important to understand, that this is a companion app, and it is not sufficient to fully learn the prayer on its own. We also strongly recommend that you learn to read Arabic, as English letters and phonemes are not sufficient to convey all sounds found in Arabic. Learning to read Arabic will allow you to perform your prayers in the best way and will give you access to the Holy Quran. The easiest and most effective way to learn both prayer and reading Arabic is to find a good teacher.

Major features: ($ = paid add-on)

• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.

• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.

• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.

• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).

• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)

• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.

• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).

• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)

• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)

• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)

Her bir cümlenin kaç kere tekrar etmesini ve tekrarlar arasında kaç saniye beklemesini istiyorsanız, hemen o ekranda bunları ayarlayabilirsiniz. Sureyi veya duayı dinlemeye başladığınız anda bile tekrar sayısı ve bekleme zamanı ayarlarında değişiklik yapabilirsiniz. Dinlediğiniz ayeti (veya cümleyi) tekrar etmeniz için araya uygun bir bekleme zamanı ayarlamanızı tavsiye ederiz.

Sure veya duanın sadece belli bir yerini dinlemek isterseniz istediğiniz satıra parmağınızın ucuyla dokunmanız yeterli. Hangi satıra dokunursanız uygulamamız o satıra geçecektir. Dilediğiniz cümleyi iyice öğrenene kadar tekrar edebileceksiniz.

Sureleri ve duaları tekrarsız bir şekilde dinlemek isterseniz tekrar sayısını ve bekleme süresini en az değere ayarlayın.

Metin boyutlarını değiştirmek isterseniz A- ve A+ düğmelerini kullanabilirsiniz.

Quickly identify stars, planets, constellations and satellites above by simply holding your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to the Night Sky!  This is all done magically.  Whether you’re looking for a constellation, or the International Space Station, let Night Sky direct you to it, then explore the object in AR!

FEATURE SET: 

- NIGHT SKY + AURA (Night Sky + Aura Subscription required) - Your Personal AI Super Astronomer!  Ask Night Sky Aura virtually anything about Space and it will know the answer.  Night Sky Aura fully interfaces with features within Night Sky, to direct you to objects you’re interested in, provide information on anything to do with astronomy, or even show you how the sky looks on the other side of the world!  With your own personal AI Super Astronomer right by your side, Night Sky Aura becomes the new natural way to interact with the sky above! 

- SKY TAGS - Make Night Sky yours, by adding personal Sky Tags to the map!  Pin Sky Tags to objects in the sky to save for future reference, and share them via iMessage so others can find them!  Sky Tags can be categorized, and are completely personal to you.  Maybe you want to tag a star as a memorial to someone, or tag something you’d like to observe later that night.  You can even add Astrophotography photos and observation notes to your Sky Tags!  

- CONNECTED STARGAZING (+ Feature) - Connected Stargazing is a revolutionary new feature that utilizes SharePlay in iOS 15.1, allowing you to stargaze with others when you are apart!  Start a FaceTime Audio call with those who you would like to stargaze with, then create a session by adding objects for everyone to find in the sky!

- SPATIAL AUDIO OBJECT NAVIGATION - Using AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, search for an object when automatic sky tracking is on, and Night Sky will make the star, planet or constellation ‘chirp’ in the 360° soundscape, assisting you to navigate to the object with sound!

- AR SKY WINDOW - Erase the ceiling of your bedroom, lounge or classroom with AR!  Night Sky intelligently detects the ceiling or other flat surface in a room, and can make it magically disappear to reveal the sky behind it!  

- BILLIONS OF STARS!  (+ Feature) - Space is vast, so Night Sky has been hyper charged with over 1.7 BILLION STARS streamed from the cloud!  With a new super deep zoom (greater than 10X before), prepare to delve deeper into space than you ever imagined!

- MAPS UI - A clean and familiar interface with Search features including Quick Find, intelligent Night Red Mode, Light Pollution indicator and easy to use menu, prepare to navigate Night Sky quicker than ever before!

- AR PLANETARY PORTALS & AR GRAND ORRERY (+ Features) - Step onto the surface of other planets by placing AR portals around your room!  Or walk around the entire Solar System using the newly refreshed interactive Grand Orrery!
