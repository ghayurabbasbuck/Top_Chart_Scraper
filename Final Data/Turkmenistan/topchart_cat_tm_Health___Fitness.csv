Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.
- The subscription automatically renews. The renewal cost will be charged to your account 24 hours before the end of the current subscription, if auto-renewal has not been turned off.
- You can easily manage subscriptions in your Apple account settings – for example, turn off automatic subscription renewal right after purchase.

FROM THE APP'S CREATOR 

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!


Growing up is not easy! But we support parents and children every day on this exciting journey.

By capturing dozens of data points every second, WHOOP delivers personalized Sleep, Strain, Recovery, Stress, and health insights—24/7. WHOOP uses those insights to provide coaching based on your body’s unique physiology and recommends everything from when to go to bed to new daily behaviors that will help you reach your goals.

If you’re new to WHOOP, you can try both the wearable and app free for 1 month. Terms and conditions apply.

WHOOP is screenless, so all your data lives in the WHOOP app—for a distraction-free focus on your health. The WHOOP app requires a WHOOP wearable.

How it works:

Healthspan*: A powerful way to quantify your age and slow your Pace of Aging. Backed by leading longevity research, it pinpoints the daily habits that impact your long-term health.

Sleep: WHOOP helps you understand how well you sleep each night by measuring your Sleep Performance. Every morning, WHOOP provides a Sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Planner calculates how much sleep you need to recover, tailored to your habits, schedule, and goals. You can even set a Haptic Alarm that wakes when you're fully rested, or at a specific time, with gentle vibration. Quality sleep is essential for improving your healthspan, metabolic mental resilience, recovery, and performance.

Recovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You'll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 1 to 99%. When you're in the green, you're ready for strain, when you're in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program.

Strain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity–it measures cardiovascular and muscular exertion to give you the most comprehensive view of the demands you put on your body. Each day, Strain Target will provide a Strain score from 0 to 21 and recommend your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score.

Stress: WHOOP gives you daily insights to pinpoint your stressors, understand your physiological response, and discover techniques to help manage. Get a real-time stress score from 0-3 and, based on your score, choose a breathwork session to enhance your alertness or increase relaxation.

Behaviors: WHOOP tracks over 160+ daily habits and behaviors—like alcohol intake, medication, and more—to better understand how these behaviors impact your body. WHOOP provides weekly guidance for behavior change and helps set accountability goals with the Journal and Weekly Plan features.

WHOOP Coach: Ask questions about your health & fitness and get highly personalized, on-demand answers. Using your unique biometric data, the latest performance science, and generative AI, WHOOP Coach generates responses on everything from training plans to why you’re feeling tired.

Menstrual Cycle Insights: Go beyond period tracking to better understand your fifth vital sign and get tailored cycle-based insights.

What else you can do in the WHOOP app:

• Dig into the details: See heart rate zones, VO₂ Max, steps, and more trends over time to adjust your behaviors, training, sleep and more based on your goals.

• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team's training is going.

• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple's Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience.
