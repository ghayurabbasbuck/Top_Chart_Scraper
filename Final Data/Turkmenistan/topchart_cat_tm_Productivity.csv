All our servers are available at maximum speed for all f3 VPN app users.
We do not store or transfer your data to anyone. At the same time, we try to ensure your safety and speed on the Internet as much as possible.

FOR WHAT?
• Using public Wi-Fi networks in cafes, bars, the subway and other public transport, your data stored on the device often becomes available to cyber fraudsters. Often, criminals can gain access to your information. f3 VPN Proxy will increase the protection of your device from unauthorized data interception.

• When transferring files, photos and text information on social networks or instant messengers, you must enable VPN in our application, thereby protecting your confidential data.

• Using a VPN, you can get rid of intrusive advertising based on your search history, since the f3 VPN application will hide your real IP address, and many sites will not be able to find out about your preferences and life plans.

• Not satisfied with the Internet speed? Try connecting to VPN from f3 and services will be available at maximum speed.

WHY US?
- We use some of the fastest servers in different regions of the world and are ready to share with you.
- Always the maximum speed on servers in different locations.
- Connect to VPN quickly with the click of a button.
- Maximum simple settings, anyone can handle it.
