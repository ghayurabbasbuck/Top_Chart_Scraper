Why is food waste an issue?
Humans overproduce food so much, that we end up throwing ⅓ of it away.  This is a huge waste of not only the food but also the resources that went into creating that food such as the land, water, labour and money.  What’s worse, is that when food is sent to landfill it decomposes and emits the greenhouse gas methane, which is a huge contributor to climate change. 

In New Zealand, cafes, restaurants and supermarkets produce 50,000 tonnes of food waste annually. Over 60% of this waste is preventable as the food is still fit for human consumption.  Foodprint provides a practical easy-to-use solution that is appealing to users and eateries, allowing both to reduce their foodprint. 

Together, the Foodprint community rescues food, saves money and helps the environment.",2019-06-11T15:40:38Z,2025-11-24T04:46:26Z
