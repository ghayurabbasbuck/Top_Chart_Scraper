Manus is a general AI agent that bridges mind and action: it doesn't just think, it delivers results. Manus excels at various tasks in work and life, getting everything done while you rest.

From Idea to Execution
Whereas other AI tools stop at brainstorming, Manus sees your ideas to execution. Using its own “computer”, Manus breaks down your task into a to-do list, executes these subtasks, and delivers your final result.

Your Trusted Colleague
Manus works asynchronously in the cloud, meaning that you can simply close your devices and Manus will notify you when your task is complete. You can also stop and edit your prompt at any time. 

Stunning & Structured Slides
With a single prompt, Manus generates entire slide decks tailored to your needs. Whether you're presenting in a boardroom, a classroom, or online, Manus ensures your message lands. Once you are done, export or share it with colleagues and peers.

Free & Unlimited Chat
Ask any question, get instant answers. Need more power? One-click upgrade to Agent Mode with advanced capabilities from asking simple questions to creating comprehensive outputs.

Design & Deploy Websites 
Manus turns any file into an engaging website with one prompt. Spreadsheets, slides, images, resumes, books... All your files can be more sharable, interactive, and visually impressive as a website.

Image & Video Generation
For both image and video, Manus transforms simple prompts into complete stories. Whether it’s creating a poster froma piece of crumpled paper or a high fashion concept, Manus brings your inner artist to life. 

Reclaim your time
Tasks that used to take 20 hours can be reduced to one with Manus. Whether that’s turning complex data into visual representations or automating repetitive routines, leave it to Manus so that you can turn your attention to engaging tasks.
