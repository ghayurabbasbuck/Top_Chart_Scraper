That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. Our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. While our optional integrated AI features, Search Assist and Duck.ai, are private and never use your data to train AI. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads, not by exploiting your data.

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS 
Protect Your Searches by Default: DuckDuckGo Search comes built-in, so you can easily search online without being tracked.  

Shield Your Browsing History: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection blocks most trackers before they load, greatly exceeding what most popular browsers offer by default.

Secure Your Email (Optional): Use Email Protection to block most email trackers and hide your existing email address with @duck.com addresses.   

Watch YouTube Videos Without Targeted Ads: Duck Player protects you from targeted ads and cookies with a distraction-free interface that incorporates YouTube’s strictest privacy settings for embedded video. 

Automatically Enforce Encryption: Shield your data from network and Wi-Fi snoopers by forcing many sites to use an HTTPS connection.  

Escape Fingerprinting: Make it harder for companies to create a unique identifier for you by blocking attempts to combine info about your browser and device.  

Sync and Back Up Securely (Optional): Sync encrypted bookmarks and passwords across your devices. 

Clear your tabs and browsing data in a flash with the Fire Button. 

Banish cookie pop-ups and automatically set your preferences to minimize cookies and maximize privacy.

Touchpad Instead of Buttons. We are confident that navigation with swipe gestures is much more convenient than by pressing regular ""down"" or ""right"" buttons, not distracting you from the most important thing: searching for your favorite movie or series on the TV.

Still Can’t Turn the TV On? In a word, you can, but under one condition. Most new Smart TV models support the Wake-on-LAN function. It is possible only if you had already been connected to the TV earlier. Therefore, when using the application for the first time, you will need a hardware remote control. After that, you can use your Universal Remote.
