Credit Builder savings account is a deposit product, insured up to $250,000. Credit Builder is serviced by Credit Karma Credit Builder. Members with a TransUnion credit score of 619 or below at time of application may be prompted to apply for Credit Builder.

**From June 2024 to Nov 2024, members with a TU credit score of 619 or below who opened a plan and had it reported on their TU report saw an average score increase of 17 points in 3 days of activation. Late payments and other factors can negatively impact your score.

^ Borrowing Power is based on the highest offer amount available to you through Credit Karma where you have Outstanding Approval Odds. The offers themselves are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.

† Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the card shown, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's ""ability to pay standard"" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.

HOW KALSHI WORKS
Kalshi is the largest federally regulated exchange where you can buy and sell contracts on the outcome of events. For example, NASA announced a manned mission to the moon. Contract prices reflect the view of traders as to the chances of the event happening. You think it's going to happen, so you buy contracts for it. Contracts cost between 1¢ to 99¢, and can be sold at any time. At close, each contract is worth $1 if you’re right.
TRADE SPORTS
Love day trading? Love sports?
Now you can combine both. Kalshi lets you trade on real outcomes across football, baseball, basketball, golf, MMA, tennis and more.
Will Baltimore beat Philly?
Will the total score go over 45?
Trade all your favorite sports with highly liquid markets for every pro football and college football game. The live trading vibrancy of these markets is unrivalled.
HOW IS KALSHI REGULATED?
Kalshi is federally regulated as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Kalshi’s affiliate, Kalshi Klear LLC, is a CFTC regulated clearinghouse that provides clearing services for Kalshi. The clearinghouse holds member funds and clears trades.
TRADE YOUR CONVICTIONS
Find markets that align with your interests and opinions. For example, if you think a recession is coming, trade recession and S&P markets. You can finally put your money where your mouth is.
REDUCE FINANCIAL RISK
Hedge against events that might affect your finances. For example, if you hold stocks, trade Fed and inflation markets to protect your portfolio.
KALSHI VS. STOCKS
Event contracts are more direct. You trade on the outcome of an event, not the future price of a stock. This means your profits are not tied to the company’s performance. No pattern day trading restrictions. You can trade as much or as little as you want, whenever you want. This gives you more flexibility to manage your risk. In stocks, you can be right and still lose money. The price of a stock is not always based on fundamentals. Other factors, like news or market sentiment, can also affect it.
KALSHI VS. OPTIONS
Event contracts are simpler. Options are complex instruments with many factors that affect their price, making them difficult to predict. Free from time decay. Contract prices reflect the view of traders as to the chances of the event happening, while options lose value over time even if the underlying asset doesn't change in price.
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO START?
You can open and maintain a Kalshi account for free. Our markets require less capital than others, making them a great way to diversify your investments without risking too much.
