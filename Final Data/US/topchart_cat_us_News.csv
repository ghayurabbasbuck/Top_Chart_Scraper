us,United States,News,6009,2,1064216828,Reddit,"REDDIT, INC.",https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828?uo=4,0.0,4.76119,3317082,News,"Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.

Reddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.

Redditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.

Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:
• r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions
• r/funny, which is full of humorous content
• r/science, for scientific discussions and news
• r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure

On Reddit you’ll find:
• Thousands of community groups
Breaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.

• Loads of laughs
Find memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.

• AMAs, or ""Ask Me Anything""
Celebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.

• The best discussions on any topic
Reddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.

• Get answers to anonymous questions 
Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.

• Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU
Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.

Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.

Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.

“This year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor. In no time, our neighbors stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands.
