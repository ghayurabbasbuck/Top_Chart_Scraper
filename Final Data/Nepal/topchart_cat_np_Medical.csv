Since our inception in 2013 in the bustling city of Butwal, Rupandehi, Nepal, we have swiftly expanded our operations to other regions across Nepal, establishing ourselves as a leader in the field of pathology and laboratory medicine.

From the outset, our mission has been clear: to provide high-quality and advanced diagnostic services that prioritize patient care above all else. This commitment to excellence is reflected in our Category ""A"" accreditation, a prestigious recognition we have proudly held since 2013. Our state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and collection centers are equipped with the latest technology and staffed by highly trained professionals dedicated to delivering accurate and timely diagnostic results.
Our Services
At National Path Lab, we offer an extensive range of diagnostic services designed to meet the diverse needs of our patients. Our offerings include preventive health check-up packages and specialized tests in areas such as immunology, oncology, neurology, gynecology, and nephrology. We continuously strive to expand our service range to stay at the forefront of medical advancements and ensure that our patients receive the best possible care.

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry is one of our key services, providing versatile applications in biomedical research, diagnostics, and drug development. This technology aids in immunophenotyping, cell cycle analysis, and drug screening, enabling detailed examination and characterization of cells. By analyzing the physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light, flow cytometry provides rapid, accurate, and multi-parametric data. This technology is particularly useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, and HIV/AIDS.

Flow cytometry's ability to analyze thousands of particles per second and simultaneously measure multiple parameters makes it an invaluable tool in both clinical and research settings. The applications of flow cytometry extend beyond immunophenotyping to include cell sorting, which allows for the isolation of specific cell populations for further analysis. This capability is critical for advancing personalized medicine, where tailored treatments are developed based on the specific characteristics of a patient's cells.

Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ensures safe and effective medication dosing by measuring drug concentrations in patients' blood. This service guides personalized treatment, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. TDM is particularly crucial for medications with narrow therapeutic indices, where the range between therapeutic and toxic doses is small. By regularly monitoring drug levels, healthcare providers can adjust dosages to achieve the desired therapeutic effect while avoiding toxicity.",2025-01-24T08:00:00Z,2025-10-31T04:02:47Z
