Zest integrates a mind-blowing cooking education into your routine. Learn to cook with us through step-by-step explanations of foundational cooking concepts in fewer than 10 minutes and dishes that bring the concept to life. Our recipes are created by two former Michelin star chefs, distilled by a home chef, and cooked by you, the superstar home cook that you are (or will be). We don't assume any prior culinary knowledge. We meet you where you are and help you improve.
 
Stop copying traditional recipes - start learning from Zest. We've cooked those delicious Bon Appetit dinners. But when we took away the recipes we felt like lost puppies. Zest is designed to teach you the how's and why's of cooking. So when the recipe is gone you can confidently navigate the kitchen. The promise: Taste improvement after one dinner with Zest.

FEATURES:

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
We've all tried cooking a TikTok recipe. You rewatch the video 13 times to figure out what the hell is going on. Zest embeds videos throughout recipes so you can click into content when you need it. No more pausing and restarting. Learn at your own pace.
 
CONCEPT VIDEOS
Watch a short video on a new concept at your own pace and then cook recipes that reinforce what you've learned. We dive into topics like the science of tasting and the basics of seasoning, sautéing, roasting and more!

SKILL VIDEOS
Don't know how to dice an onion? Don't be embarrassed, we got you covered. Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).

CURATED MENU
Choose a menu to fit your preferences. Tired of wasting produce? Search for dishes including what’s already in your fridge. Got allergies? Compile safe recipes in your menu to find them when you’re ready to get cooking. 

GROCERY LIST
Shop your menu with our automated grocery list. Plus, utilize our helpful tips while you shop. Don't know what a neutral oil is? We got you covered.

PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Rate the recipes you cook, so we can recommend similar ones.

How many times have you opened the fridge and thought to yourself -- what can I make ?

How many times have you thrown away an ingredient, because you couldn't figure out how to use it before it expired ?

SuperCook to the rescue!

Unlike other recipe apps,  SuperCook only shows you recipes that require the ingredients you already have.  

All the recipes you see on SuperCook  are recipes you can make right now.  No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends

Why purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?

Here’s how it works:
• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.
• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. 
• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!
• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.

SuperCook’s Unique App Features:
 
--Customized Recipe Ideas--
We’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.

All you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!

SuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  

--Easily Add Your Ingredients--
Save time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.

Just open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!
 
--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--
The app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!

When you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.
 
--Get Creative in the Kitchen--
SuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.

With over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).

--What's on the menu ?--
The menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.

Most likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.

--Reduce food waste--
Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.
