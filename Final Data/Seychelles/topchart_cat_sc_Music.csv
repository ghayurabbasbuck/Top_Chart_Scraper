User Reviews

I'm a piano teacher of 15 years and have more and more students who want to play chords and improvise. This app is a perfect resource for them. I like it because it's thorough but, at the same time, straightforward.

I am new to piano and familiar with some scales and chord progressions, but this app will help me to understand and explore various combinations. I pair this app with additional learning material online to help me fully understand the math/science behind music.

This app is excellent for understanding scales, chords, chord progressions, and the circle of fifths. I like the easy-to-use interface. It only includes standard scales and chords. I have another app with many complicated and confusing scales that I've never heard of, much less can pronounce. I just wanted something to show me the standard scales and chords, which this app does. It also sounds like a chord or scale.

It gives you so much when you’re stuck composing. I’m relatively new to music theory, and this makes everything I’ve been learning about chords super clear.

I have taught piano for 33 years. This is the best app for any level of the student. It is so easy to use; kids love it when I use the iPad in their lessons.

Hey I am Erik, the solo programmer of YouDJ. I worked by passion for 15 years to build this app, that's why this app is absolutely free with no ads, for reel, you can see by yourself! 

With the YouDJ mixer, you can mix like a pro with no preliminary knowledge. This app is all about giving you an easy and intuitive interface that even your grandma can use!

YouDJ offers a range of cool features and DJ tools for you to have fun. While it mays not be the most complete DJ app, we offer you the must-have, high quality, DJ tools that will take your mixes to the next level.

From 16 sound effects and an 80 sounds sampler to vinyl scratching, auto beat synchronization, keylock, loops, automix, and hot cues. These features will ensure you have everything you need to unleash your creativity.

The YouDJ mixer comes preloaded with a collection of music, but you can also play MP3 files stored on your device.

It's important to understand that no DJ app, including YouDJ, can integrate with Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music due to their closed platforms and the DRM encryption on their songs. Also, legally mixing popular music without paying on mobile platforms doesn't exist unfortunately.

The YouDJ Mixer is available on all desktop and mobile platforms, so you can rock the party wherever you go. But we highly recommend you to try the computer version too (you.dj).

So, what are you waiting for? 

Grab your headphones, download YouDJ, and start your DJ journey today!

If you appreciate the effort I've invested in developing this app without any coin, make sure to leave a review. It seriously means the world to me and helps me out big time.

Much love and thanks in advance!

How to Mix:

You're equipped with a classic DJ setup featuring two turntables and a mixer. 
Your mission? Simultaneously unleash the magic of two songs, each playing on its respective turntable, and then skillfully blend them together using the mixer. 

To spice up your mix, you can use effects such as the loops, the fx pads, the eq, the scratch, the sampler, the hot cues.
—------------------------------

Shoutout to all of you for showing mad love to YouDJ. It seriously keeps me hyped to keep this project going!

Go ahead and have fun with YouDJ!
