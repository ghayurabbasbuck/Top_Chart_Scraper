Map, navigator, public transport, guidebook and directory – all one icon away in your phone. It will show your location, find a required address, help you to plot your route by car, bus, bicycle or by foot. And then you can see your friends right on the map in 2GIS!

The app is free and it works both online and offline – just download the required city or even a region and use maps without Internet connection.

GPS navigation. Get ready to see precisely depicted roads with tunnels and multi-level junctions in 3D. 2GIS will build an optimal route providing for traffic jam, road accidents and roads under construction. It will show your speed so that you don’t have to glance at speed meter too often. It will give you a warning of speed and other cameras ahead so that you can avoid getting a ticket. It will show you the nearest parking lots. The app combines different technologies to make route following more precise, even on long-distance travels without Internet connection. Turn on 2GIS in Apple CarPlay — it’s free.

Maps maxed out. 2GIS is detailed maps of more than 1400 cities: with realistic models of buildings, neighborhoods, roads, bus stops – even trees in a park and entrances to buildings are shown! Floor-by-floor layouts are available for malls, train and bus stations, airports and other complex buildings – you will not get lost! As well as layers with real estate, car sharing and other useful services.

Public transport. Build routes by subway, bus, trolley or commuter train. Choose the shortest ones or the most convenient ones, with or without change of transport. Turn on bus tracking on the map in real time. Go by the schedule and see credible estimated time of bus arrival to your bus stop.

Navigator for pedestrians, bicycles and scooters. 2GIS can build routes through a city providing for inclinations and elevations, cycle lanes and stairs. It is particularly convenient for scooter riders or people walking with strollers. 

Friends on the Map. Add your friends and family members as Friends in 2GIS to see each other on the map in the city in real time! No need to ask, “Where are you?”, just check location on the map. It makes meeting planning easier (especially if someone is running late) or allows for spontaneous meetings! Send an emoji to a friend to offer a meeting or start conversation in chat without a need to switch to a messenger.

You can also send a link to your location or route to any person, not just friends. And even create temporary groups for travels. Manage who can see your location. It is convenient, private and helps you to always stay in touch.

This function may be used as a family location finder: add your child or grandmother and grandfather to Friends and you will not have to worry if they don’t respond in a messenger. You will get an automatic push notification when your relative is at home.

Everything about the city. In 2GIS search, you will find contact details of companies and organizations, addresses, business hours, restaurant menus, information on products and services, and even pictures with prices. All information is updated regularly.

Reviews. 2GIS not only helps you to find companies, products and services, but also to choose the best of the best! The app stores tens of thousands of reviews, real photos from customers and honest rating of a place.

Guidebooks. Discover interesting places just for you in any city! Includes original selections, audio guides and sightseeing attractions in 3D.

Navigator for trucks. Cargo navigator gets directions for trucks considering the individual characteristics of vehicles and cargo.

The Apple Watch companion app conveys a map and a route created using your phone on your watch screen, and also shows your current location. Vibration will alert you when you need to turn. The Friends on the map widget on the main screen will keep you informed of your loved ones' whereabouts.

It helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.

No surprises on the road
Get detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. 
It also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.

Get multi-stop directions
There’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.
Plan a route with 4-10 stops and tap ""Optimize."" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.

Get your bearings anywhere 
No matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.

Never get lost offline
Find places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.

Pay for parking 
Look for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.

Pay for fuel
Choose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.

Steer clear of poor road conditions
Turn on ""Avoid bad and unpaved roads"" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.

Plan your trips ahead of time
Adjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.
For example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.

Get directions tailored to your vehicle
If you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select ""Add truck"" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.

Monitor traffic in real time
Yandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.

See your route laid out in front of you 
Yandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.

The app works in Russia, Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.
