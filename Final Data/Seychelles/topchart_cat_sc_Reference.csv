sc,Seychelles,Reference,6006,18,1125641374,Al Quran - Read Qur'an Offline,RAVINDHIRAN SUMITHRA,https://apps.apple.com/sc/app/al-quran-read-quran-offline/id1125641374?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Reference,"The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam. It consists of 114 chapters (called Surahs) and over 6,000 verses (Ayahs). Written in Arabic, it’s considered by Muslims to be the most beautiful and perfect form of literature ever. Each verse is seen as guidance for humanity and an answer to life’s questions.

The Qur'an emphasizes the oneness of God, meaning there is only one God, and Muhammad is His final messenger. It provides guidance on all aspects of life, from spiritual matters like worship to practical matters like social justice, family, and ethics.

The Qur'an is not arranged in chronological order but rather with the longest chapters at the beginning and the shortest ones at the end. The first chapter, Al-Fatiha, is a brief prayer and is recited in every unit of Muslim prayer.

The Qur'an is in classical Arabic, and while it is translated into many languages, Muslims believe that the original Arabic contains meanings that cannot be fully captured in any translation. Translations are used to help non-Arabic speakers understand the message, but the original text is seen as the purest form. Many translations are accompanied by commentary (Tafsir) to provide deeper insights.

The Qur'an is not just a book of religious rituals but a guide for everyday life. It addresses everything from personal conduct to societal laws, and Muslims are encouraged to live by its teachings.
