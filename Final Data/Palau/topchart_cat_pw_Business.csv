VIP Access adds strong authentication to your normal login in one of the following ways: 
•        Dynamically generate a one-time use security code on your mobile device. Use that code along with your username and password.
•        Receive a push notification on your mobile device that you approve as authentication. If your organization requires you to define an additional device authentication mechanism to meet the security requirements, you are prompted for the additional local authentication such as passphrases or biometrics.

Or you will change your environment! 
That is where we come in.
Wellbees is here to help you create new habits by using the power of community. 
Pick your new habit, challenge others within the community, get ready to get motivated and inspired by them in return! 
Here are some of the awesome things you can do on Wellbees:
