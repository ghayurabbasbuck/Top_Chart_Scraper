Available on the iPhone and Apple Watch, Pedometer++ is the best way to review your step count, walking distance, active calories, and heart rate data. 

Set a custom step count goal, and track your progress over time. The built-in graphs make reviewing your data easy and fun. Everyone loves awards, and Pedometer++ includes a range of Badges to motivate and reward your hard work! The app also totals how far you’ve walked each day, and even counts the flights of stairs you encounter each day.

With full-featured widget support, Pedometer++ can display your step count or update you on your daily progress right from your iPhone's lock screen or home screen. You can also share your workouts with others and view trends over time.

The Apple Watch app puts all this data on your wrist. With a wide range of Complications, it’s easy to check your progress with just a glance. Add a single Complication to your daily watch face, or add several to build a comprehensive fitness-focused look! 

DETAILS:
For best results, keep your iPhone on you as you move throughout the day, ideally in a pocket close to your hips. If you have an Apple Watch, you can set Pedometer++ to sync step data across your devices for the most accurate data possible.

The Apple Watch app can also start and track indoor and outdoor walking and running workouts and can serve as your guide while hiking.


ROUTES & MAPPING:
Pedometer++ is your ultimate companion for exploring the great outdoors. It allows you to import GPX files for waypoints and routes set by others. 

You can also use the app to create your own routes. Simply tap on your desired start and end points, and Pedometer++ will find the shortest route between them. You can then tweak the route based on terrain, trail popularity, or personal preference. 

Pedometer++ shows the distance of a route, the elevation changes you will encounter, and the estimated time it will take you to reach your destination. You can also monitor the weather that is expected along your route.

The best part is that custom routing is available on the iPhone and Apple Watch. Of course, being out in nature often means losing cell service, so Pedometer++ allows you to download offline map data for large areas, not just for your specific route. Offline map data is also available on the iPhone and Apple Watch, as long as your Watch is within range of your phone.


NOTES:
Pedometer++ integrates with the Apple Health app to collect and display step data collected by your Apple Watch. 

Pedometer++ includes an optional premium subscription. This is offered on a monthly or annual basis. If you choose to purchase a subscription, your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. After purchase, you can turn off auto-renewal anytime by going to your Account Settings on the App Store.

Access to iPhone-based workout tracking is only available to Pedometer++ Premium subscribers.
