5 Stars A.Woroniec
Excellent men's mag. A valuable men's magazine. - This magazine truly shines with excellent, well-written, interesting, and valuable articles. The first issue I've read so far is full of a variety of content that makes for a satisfying and entertaining read. It covered topics about health, working advice, girl advice, and cool gadgets just to name a few. And let's not forget the girls who are so beautiful they will break your heart. To be honest, I was not expecting too much out of a men's magazine, but this one changed my assumptions. This mag will remain on my newsstand for a long time to come.

5 Stars - BrightsideRocket
I have been looking for a mag like this for some time. Great for girls, gadgets, business etc. It is like an educated FHM but not as pompous as GQ. I hope you keep it up and the price is perfect for a download mag.

Love the pictures, and the fact that the magazine keeps the same theme for the entire issue. Price is also great. Keep it up.

Many of us born in an online generation can only sigh in nostalgia at the glamour and wonder of print fashion magazines from the early 2000s. As the world moved online, the once iconic fashion media companies failed to evolve - they gave us lazy pdfs to browse on slow and buggy e-readers as Inst*gr*m took over to give us the fast immersive content we wanted. Their disinterest in the preservation of beauty online is clear and it’s time we had a new medium to explore and appreciate fashion for fashion’s sake. MDLA is an experiment to revive the glory of early fashion media re-imagined through powerful online media technology from present day.

MDLA Runway brings you a variety of powerful features you’d expect from a modern fashion runway viewer:

* Intuitive Interface - Flip through runway looks with a simple swipe or drag. Jump through to your favorite designer’s early years with just a tap and slide. No endless scroll, no ads, no interruptions

* Powerful Search - Search for your favorite collections down to their specific year and season. Find archive collections by your favorite designers from their early years and from labels they previously worked at. Don’t worry about typos or using shorthands - we know what you mean :)

* Lightning Fast - Browse high resolution look images from the runway loaded in a flash of a second

* Smart Boards - Generate moodboards based on any style, color or vibe even if its super descriptive. Automatically filter your favorite designer or label to collect powerful references in an instant.

* 3D Showcase - Play around with high resolution 3D captures of rare archive “grail” pieces complete with added context from its rich fashion history and references from its original collection for you to explore and learn

* Immersive Editorials - Explore our selection of hand-curated stories of iconic archive pieces, profiles of in vogue runway designers, lost fashion techniques and striking editorial campaigns

Our catalog features thousands of collections dating back to the early 90s from the most iconic names in fashion
Browse the archives from your favorite labels: Dior - Gucci - Louis Vuitton - Prada - Balenciaga - Saint Laurent - Margiela
As well as your favorite designers: Raf Simons - Rick Owens - Tom Ford - Alexander McQueen - Hedi Slimane - Virgil Abloh - Issey Miyake


MDLA is for high fashion followers, meticulous moodboard makers, archive fashion collectors, y2k fashion magazine enjoyers, small town gossip girl lovers, vintage fashion shoppers, aesthetics respecters, ‘it’ girls, clout guys, connoisseurs, hobbyists, tasteful amateurs and most importantly, you :)",2022-09-09T07:00:00Z,2025-11-08T01:26:30Z

Ни на каком другом языке вы не найдете столько литературных вопросов, вопросов с юмором, вопросов с контекстом происходящего в мире сегодня. И всё это в обычных кроссвордах, хотя, казалось бы, какая ерунда. Русский народ – народ слова. И любит своё слово, и держит своё слово, и относится к слову как к самому дорогому.

Сканворды в приложении разнообразные - попроще и посложнее, с фотографиями, с классическими вопросами или ассоциативными: «одним словом» либо «раз слово, два слово», как подсказки старца Фура. В любом журнале есть один англо-русский сканворд и один «дыркавнос», надеюсь, вы поймёте, почему его так назвали. На каждой странице вас встречает персонаж нашей весёлой семейки. Присоединяйтесь!

Все сканворды для читателя бесплатны. Это годовая коллекция: 52-53 номера по 20 сканвордов в каждом. Полный годовой арсенал сканвордов «съест» на телефоне около 50 Мбайт - картинки маленькие, текст - это текст. Мы ценим место на вашем телефоне.

Интернет для разгадывания не нужен. При условии, что сами сканворды уже на вашем телефоне. Каждую пятницу выходит новый номер журнала. Если вы оставили активной опцию «уведомление», то один раз в неделю в пятницу в 12-00 по местному времени придёт напоминание о новом номере. При входе в приложение загрузка нового журнала происходит автоматически и при её успешном завершении более не повторяется. Кроме того, можно загрузить или удалить на телефон поштучно любой из журналов, либо через «Настройки» скачать все журналы в один клик.

Основные возможности, в том числе доступ ко всем сканвордам, в приложении для читателя бесплатны. Банкет оплачивает рекламодатель. Ему разрешено иметь один узкий баннер на каждой странице + один показ межстраничной рекламы перед открытием сканворда. Наш рекламодатель не прерывает процесс разгадывания. Также рекламодатель щедро награждает читателя бесплатными подсказками за просмотр своих роликов. 

Любой читатель вправе, но не обязан, «перебить» рекламодателя, и: а) отключить рекламу навсегда, б) оформить подписку, которая на срок подписки отключает рекламу и даёт неограниченные подсказки, в) набрать подсказок на развес. Все эти возможности представлены на витрине в «Магазине».

Подписка - стандартный механизм Apple. 
1) Подписка возможна на три срока - неделя, месяц или год.
2) Подписка автоматически продлеваемая. Средства за возобновление подписки будут взиматься в течение 24 часов до конца текущего периода. 
3) Подписка подключается или отключается стандартно через iTunes, ссылка управления внизу. При желании отказаться от возобновления подписки пользователю необходимо это сделать не позднее, чем за 24 часа до конца текущего периода. При этом оплаченный период подписки отработает до конца.

Hello! Welcome to Kandy Magazine. First, thank you to the 1% who clicked  ...more. When I founded Kandy 14 years ago, I had a simple mission - deliver a new kind of men's magazine. A magazine which was more visual than words. Our first 2012 iPad issue delivered. A year later our first iPhone issue raised the bar. We told stories visually more than textually. We were a hit!

In our early years, we kept to this vision, consistently publishing pictorials which told the story. A photo and a cute blurb or brief caption. As we grew in popularity - yes it is true that in 2014 we were the most popular magazine in the app store, more popular than People, Cosmo, Men's Health and GQ - higher profile celebrities desired the exposure Kandy delivered. To accommodate, we moved away from our fun, creative visual magazine towards your traditional, boring editorial magazine. That was our first mistake. 

Shortly thereafter, the new layout caught the attention of potential ad reps who advised we tone down the sexy and increase the text in articles. That was our second mistake. It did not take long for our readership to drop and our global audience as well. 

To be fair, our decline was not all self-induced. In our rocket ship rise to the top of the app store rankings, we maximized Apple's newsstand app exposure. It was where you went to discover magazines, much in the way when you would walk into a bookstore or by a street vendor magazine newsstand. It showed the current cover of the most recent issue and with our magazine covers who would not be intrigued to check out Kandy. However, in a perfect storm of events outside our influence, big publishers sold their private newsstand app to Apple which turned it into what you know today as News+. Kandy is excluded. 


Starting now, we are returning to our photo story issues. More girls, more photos, less words. What you wanted in the beginning and what you want today. We are not an adult magazine, there is no nudity. Our photos are classic glamour, bikini swimsuit and lingerie. I hope you enjoy Kandy.

They say every picture tells a story. Kandy digital / mobile magazine lets pictures tell the story. It is for men who enjoy Live Sports events, fitness and exercise programs combined with the latest men's fashion and watch style. You will become a Kandy magazine subscriber to the app.

If you are only fans of of Premier Leagues, UEFA or NFL football or enjoy F1, Rugby and Golf and the scores as well, Kandy magazine has all your live sporting interests covered.

Of course, any real man enjoys a wide range of topics, Kandy delivers what you need. Current trends for men's fashion, style and the hottest Rolex, Omega, Tag Heuer, Patek Philippe watches men are buying.

Are you old school, classic lads magazine reader who loved Loaded, Maxim magazine, FHM, Esquire, Nuts, Front, Zoo, Men's Health, Stuff and GQ? Kandy rolls all that good Stuff into its digital issues optimized for both iPads and iPhones.
