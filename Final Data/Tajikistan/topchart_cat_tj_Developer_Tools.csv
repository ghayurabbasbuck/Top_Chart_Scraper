Features:
1. Support HTTP and HTTPs traffic analysis
2. Support HTML, Javascript, CSS, picture (webp, jpeg, png) preview, and binary data viewing
3. Support for setting packet capture rules
4. Support historical packet capture records
5. Support filtering historical packet content
6. Support exporting the captured packet content

Instructions:
1. The software can support HTTP packet capture by default. If you need to capture and parse HTTPs traffic, you need to install a certificate
2. Click the start button, the system will create and connect to the vpn, and start the packet capture process; if you reject the vpn configuration, the packet capture cannot be performed
3. Click the orange task bar to view the current session, and click the session to view the session request and response
4. Click the request line and response line in the session to export the corresponding value
5. You can filter the content of a specific domain name through the filter button
6. You can export the session content through the export button
7. Click the stop button, a history record will be generated for subsequent viewing
8. If you need to clean up all data, you can go to the settings page and click the clear all data button


How the software works:
After opening the packet capture, the software will start a vpn and direct the vpn data packet to the local HTTP proxy server. Complete the analysis and storage of the data packet in the local proxy server. For HTTTPs data, you need to install and trust the certificate to successfully parse it.

Data security:
Since packet capture software involves user privacy data, privacy protection is the most important design consideration for software. To this end, we have made the following mechanism for this purpose:
1. The software's CA key and CA certificate are dynamically and randomly generated by the software and stored in the sandbox. No one can know the user's CA private key.
2. The certificate cannot be shared between different users.
3. After reinstalling the application, the history will cause the certificate to become invalid, and the user can manually delete the certificate in the settings.
4. The certificate is valid for one year. After the certificate expires, the user needs to regenerate it before it can be used.
5. The HTTP data captured by the software is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to any other place.
6. The user cannot modify the network request through the software to prevent some improper behavior.

System configuration instructions:
HTTP proxy server: 127.0.0.1:9080
Certificate description file name: Traffic Capture YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm, where YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm is the time when the certificate is generated

FEATURES

- Use folders stored locally on your iPhone/iPad or in iCloud
- Serve static files and websites over HTTP
- Run the server also while the app is in the background
- Enable Directory Listing to browse the selected folder in your browser
- Multitask in SplitView on iPad by eg. using the server and Safari at the same time
- Add password to control access to shared content
- Customize Directory Listing: theme, dotfile visibility, footer text

HOW TO

1. Choose a folder and press “start”
2. Open the generated IP address in a browser on a device in the same WiFi network
3. Done, there is no third step!

USE CASES

- Quickly share files on your iPhone/iPad with other devices in the same WiFi network
- Host a static website, useful for eg. software developers working on the go
- Send files to devices that have limited connectivity features (eg. GPS navigation, gaming consoles etc)
- Create a small media server for your household

TIPS
- The server works on and is visible to other devices only on the same WiFi network (ie. connected to the same router)
- This is a static server which means can’t be used as eg. a PHP or NodeJS backend server
- The Background Mode requires an audio track played while the app is not visible. Go to settings to pick from a number of pleasant nature sounds!",2023-01-29T08:00:00Z,2023-02-13T03:21:11Z
