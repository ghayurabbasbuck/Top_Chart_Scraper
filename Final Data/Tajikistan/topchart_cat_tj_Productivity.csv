— Следите за расходами и остатком ГБ, минут и SMS

Следите за своими тратами и тратами близких, скачивайте детализацию, проверяйте остаток минут, SMS и ГБ интернета, анализируйте, сколько тратите — доступны данные за последние полгода.

— ﻿﻿Пополняйте баланс и управляйте финансами

— Загляните в Поддержку

Здесь можно написать в чат, узнать про все возможности приложения, измерить скорость интернета, посмотреть статистику смартфона и не только.

— Пользуйтесь всеми возможностями «Защитника»

Сервис цифровой безопасности Защитник определит, с какого номера звонят и заблокирует мошеннические и спам-звонки. На нежелательные звонки с возможной рекламой ответит за вас, сделает запись звонков и пришлёт расшифровку. «Безопасный звонок» проанализирует разговор с помощью ИИ и предупредит во время разговора, если вы разговариваете с возможным мошенником. Защитник для своих пришлет уведомление, если близкий говорит с возможным мошенником. А если из-за мошенников вы потеряли деньги, «Страхование от мошенничества» позволит вернуть до 1,5 млн рублей.

Определитель номера покажет информацию о незнакомом номере: категорию, регион, оператора связи.Фильтр звонков и антиспам работают в фоновом режиме. Голосовой помощник может озвучить, кто звонит, и предупредить о потенциальной угрозе. «Анализ утечек персональных данных» ищет вашу конфиденциальную информацию в сети, а если находит — подсказывает, что делать дальше.

Создайте Семейную группу, чтобы экономить на связи вместе с близкими, быть в курсе местонахождения друг друга и совместно управлять номерами и настройками тарифов. Больше заботы о семье с расширенными опциями безопасности.


— Подключите МТС Секретарь

Если не можете ответить на звонок, его примет Секретарь. Поможет, когда неудобно взять трубку — на встрече, в театре или в шумном месте. Если вы не ответили в течение 20 секунд, Секретарь сделает это за вас, а потом пришлёт запись разговора и его расшифровку. Он также может перевести звонок в чат: слова собеседника придут вам сообщениями, а ваши ответы в реальном времени озвучит Секретарь.


— Используйте интеллектуальную запись звонков

В Мой МТС есть автоматическая запись звонков по мобильной сети и через приложение — как входящих, так и исходящих. Запись разговора сохраняется в аудиоформате и в виде текстовой расшифровки. При этом файлы хранятся в облаке: не занимают память телефона и всегда доступны в приложении. Запись телефонного разговора помогает вернуться к звонку и вспомнить важные детали.
