•	“Excellent app. I wouldn't park without it. Best thing is, you only pay for the time you have parked. No need to drive off with an amount of parking time paid and not used. Everyone should have this app with them.
•	“I've been using this for over a month now. Seems to work a treat. Beats waiting for a credit card transaction to happen”

How it works

With CellOPark you can instantly start and stop parking a paid parking session in a CellOPark zone by using the app to scan the sign-posted QR code or select the zone number; confirm your car from a list of vehicles in your account and press ‘Start’. The cloud based CellOPark portal gives you secure access parking to your history as well as the ability to produce reports, change your account settings and control your parking payments online.

The optional Premium membership is $1.99 per vehicle per month and only charged in months the CellOPark app is used. Premium account holders receive push notification reminders after driving away from a parking bay and SMS reminders before allowable parking time ends. 

Registering with CellOPark is easy and best of all it's FREE – so sign up now and start enjoying a new level of parking convenience.

CellOPark is available with selected campus parking providers throughout Australia and in cities such as Brisbane, Wollongong and Fremantle. Look out for CellOPark zone signage coming soon to a city near you.

In an emergency, time and location accuracy are critical. By downloading the ‘Emergency +’ app, you’ll equip yourself with a powerful tool that will help you call Triple Zero (000) quickly, and allow you to accurately communicate your location to emergency call-takers.
 
‘Emergency +’ is a national app developed by Australia’s emergency services and their government industry partners, helping people to call the right number at the right time, anywhere in Australia. Emergency + also includes SES and Police Assistance Line numbers as options, so non-emergency calls are made to the most appropriate number.
 
When calling Triple Zero (000), remember to stay focused, stay relevant and stay on the line. Before you call ask yourself:
 
* Is someone seriously injured or in need of urgent medical help?
* Is your life or property being threatened?
* Have you just witnessed a serious accident or crime?
 
If you answered ‘Yes’ to any of these questions, call Triple Zero (000). Triple Zero (000) calls are free.
 
The app uses a mobile phone’s GPS functionality and what3words, so callers can provide emergency call-takers with their location information as determined by their smart phone.
 
With what3words available within the Emergency+ app, Triple Zero (000) callers can confirm their exact location quickly and accurately.
what3words has divided the world into 3m squares and given each one a unique three word identifier. Addressing using what3words works offline - ideal when you have no data coverage or are in a remote location.",2013-12-04T12:26:21Z,2025-06-30T05:47:21Z
