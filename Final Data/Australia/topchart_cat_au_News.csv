You can swipe through all the news and videos in our completely re-designed app experience and subscribe to a variety of alerts, including Sport, Politics, World, Finance, Weather, Entertainment and Technology.
 
The app uses geo-targeting to alert you to 'News Near Me'. This feature sends an alert for breaking news within a few kilometres of your current location – just allow access to your location when prompted. This can be especially useful for alerts about traffic delays or accidents, fires, floods, and police operations.
 
We understand that too many alerts can be intrusive, so our team will only send ones we think you will find truly interesting. Our alerts are sent without an audible tone so you won't be disturbed at the wrong time.
 
The 9NEWS app also allows you to set your location by city or postcode so you see extra stories from your state and weather forecasts for exactly where you live.
 
If you feel you're getting too many alerts, or too few, you can easily change your subscriptions within the app on the Settings screen.

HEAR WHAT NEIGHBOURS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT NEXTDOOR

“Nextdoor is about where you live, not who you know. From helping neighbours with recommendations on reliable tradespeople to warnings about local public safety issues, it’s a great way to connect with people we may not know but share a community with.” - Dale, Sydney

""I’m very impressed with the friendliness of neighbours in Clovelly Park. I’ve made new friends using Nextdoor and get a lot of fulfillment with my side hustle job as a dog walker around the neighbourhood."" - Mary-Anne, Adelaide

""I was new to the area in 2019 and although I had lived in the next suburb for a loooong time, I did not socialise with anybody in Kingsley.

So I jumped on the Nextdoor app which I had a good experience with previously and within a year, I knew my neighbours and my neighbour's neighbours. I knew them well enough that I could easily reach out to so many of them as I both offered, and received, offers of support.

Fast forward to today, I am very happy with Nextdoor and now have over 1400 neighbours as members in my suburb alone. Every month, some of us meet over coffee, walk in a walking group, have an edible garden kommuniti and have plans for many more hyper-local meetups, groups and activities.

Thank you Nextdoor for connecting our Kommuniti and for keeping them connected."" - Allan, Perth


OUR MISSION

To make every neighbourhood feel like home.
Our mission is to make every neighbourhood feel like home. We do this by connecting neighbours to the local gems around them - people, places and information. These local connections improve our lives by fostering a sense of community and belonging no matter where we live.  

YOUR PRIVACY
Nextdoor is a trusted environment where neighbours are verified. Share online the kinds of things you’d share with your neighbours in person.

We require:
• Every neighbour’s address to place them in the right neighbourhood
• All members go by their real names, just like in person


Continued use of Location Services running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Nextdoor doesn't run Location Services in the background unless you give us permission by turning on optional features that require it.
