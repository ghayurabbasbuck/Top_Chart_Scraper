IMPORTS & EXPORTS
If you are coming from another platform, then there is no better way to get started than to import your records to Birda. We currently support imports from eBird, iNaturalist, Birdtrack and Birdlasser, with more coming soon. If you want to move your records to another platform, you are free to export all of your sightings from Birda.


LIFE LISTS
Birda automatically creates life lists of all the birds you've imported or recorded on Birda. Birda automatically generates sub-level lists based on time and geographic location. For example, you can see all your bird ticks for the last month or year and your home and patch lists (regions, countries, states/provinces & nature reserves coming soon!).


TAXONOMY
We understand that taxonomy can be complicated! This is especially true when people are trying to compare species across taxonomic authorities. For this reason, we built an industry-first solution to simplify taxonomy for our users. Our taxonomic engine makes taxonomy seamless, allowing users to view each other’s bird sightings in their taxonomy of choice, irrespective of what is being used by other users.


PRIVACY
You can choose to create a privacy zone around your address to hide the location of your garden sightings. Set up your home location, and Birda will also automatically create Home Lists and Patch lists for all the sightings you post within your Home and Patch boundaries. You have full control over what posts and GPS coordinates you share with others on Birda.

Hallow is a Christian prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.

In today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)

As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.
