Lightroom is a free photo and video editor that helps you do just that. From your dog’s goofy grin to that sunset that took your breath away, Lightroom makes it simple to bring those moments to life, just the way you see them.  

Whether you’re snapping pics on the go or curating your social feed, this app puts powerful editing tools in your pocket to make photo editing feel easy and fun. Lightroom is here to help you create photos you’re proud to share. 

Easily make your photos look amazing  
Want brighter colours? Softer backgrounds? A quick touch-up? Lightroom’s one-tap features like Quick Actions and Adaptive Presets let you enhance photo quality in seconds. These AI photo editor tools suggest the best edits for your images. Perfect for quick fixes or adding a unique vibe, no experience required. Use it as your go-to photo editor. 

Remove distractions and blur background  
Lightroom gives you access to tools that feel professional but stay approachable. Blur the photo background for a polished look, adjust the finer details, or use Generative Remove to remove objects and erase people from photos in a few taps.  

Powerful edits with zero hassle 
Take control of light with tools to tweak exposure, highlights, and shadows. Play with presets, photo effects, colour grading, hue, saturation and add a blur or bokeh effect to nail the perfect vibe. It’s all about giving you creative control while keeping it simple. 

Get inspiration from the community 
Not sure where to start? Browse photo filters and presets shared by creators around the world. Whether they’re bold edits with an AI photo editor or subtle tweaks for a polished portrait edit, find a look that matches your style - or create your own. Save your favourites and make every photo feel like you. 

Edit once, apply everywhere
Snapped a whole concert, travel day, or family gathering? Instead of editing each shot one by one, use Lightroom’s AI photo editor tool. Batch editing keeps your photo edits looking consistent - fast, easy, done.
