Powered by world leading health, radiation and weather organisations, the app provides worldwide UV levels and clear guidance as to when sun protection is and is not required.

Travelling and spending time outdoors is one of life’s great joys. Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. 

The SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.

***What are sun protection times?***
Sun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.

The app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.

***How is it different to other UV apps?***
The UV app has the backing of world-leading health and meteorological organisations making it a trusted and reliable source of advice.

Unlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. 

***What are the key features?***
