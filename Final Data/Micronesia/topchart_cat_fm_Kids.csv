It helps you quickly find the right cutting speed and RPM, feed rate, and chip load per tooth for your tools. You can also work out metal removal rate (MRR) to see how fast you’re really cutting. The app includes a tool life prediction calculator using the Taylor equation, so you can plan tool changes better. It can estimate cost per part by combining tooling cost and machine time. You also get tool life per edge or per corner to track insert usage more clearly. For quality control, CNCFeedWizard offers a simple surface finish estimator for turning and milling. It even handles radial chip thinning and spindle power needs, so your feeds and speeds stay safe, efficient, and easy to set.",2025-11-19T08:00:00Z,2025-11-19T13:07:15Z

Built-in converters help you switch between power, torque, and speed, and between coolant flow units like L/min and gal/min, plus bar and psi for pressure. The app also gives small calculators for engagement time per part, cycle time per part, and best step-over or step-down so you can tune your programs.

[Don't Miss Me When I'm Gone] After losing my parents, I move in with my godmother, Aunt Sandra. I live under her roof with her two sons-the Miller brothers-surrounded by love and care. I think I’ll end up with one of them. But everything changes when the maid’s daughter, Lola, moves in. The Miller brother I love most breaks my heart into pieces. After I leave, they lose their minds trying to find me.

[Move Aside! I'm the Final Boss] Kingsley is the secret King of King's Corps and the richest man on Earth, but when he returns from the battlefield, his childhood sweetheart brutally dumps him, thinking he's a clown. How will the King of all men make her regret it?
