Il sert à montrer la vérité musulmane de l'islam dans son ensemble.

Cette biographie répond aux objectifs suivants :

  - Considérez la personnalité du Prophète (saw) du point de vue de la prophétie et de la révélation à travers les événements qu'il a vécus pour prouver que Muhammad (saw) ne s'est pas distingué uniquement par son génie mais qu'il était avant tout un prophète inspiré, soutenu par Dieu .

  - Montrez au lecteur, l'idéal moral incarné dans la réalité dans son image la plus complète et la plus parfaite: la personnalité du Prophète (saw). Dieu a fait de lui le modèle pour toute l'humanité.

  - La biographie du Prophète (saw) aide le musulman à comprendre le Coran et à entrer dans son esprit; nombre de versets sont en effet leur illustration et leur explication dans le comportement du Prophète (saw) au cours des événements auxquels il a été confronté.

  - Fournir des connaissances musulmanes et certaines très étendues relatives à l'islam, ses préceptes et sa morale car il ne fait aucun doute que la vie du Prophète (saw) est la réalisation et la parfaite application de tous les principes de l'islam et de ses lois.

  - Fournir aux éducateurs et prédicateurs l'exemple d'une méthode d'enseignement et d'éducation très efficace. Le Prophète (saw) s'est en effet révélé être un enseignant et un éducateur distingué aux différentes étapes de sa mission.

La biographie du Prophète (saw) est celle de la réalisation de la vérité de l'islam et de son application dans le réel à travers un modèle exemplaire: Mohamed Ibn Abdullah (saw). La biographie raconte sa naissance, sa mission et les révélations que Dieu lui a données. Elle décrit son caractère, sa sincérité, sa loyauté, les miracles que Dieu a accomplis à travers lui, les différentes étapes qu'il a franchies dans l'exercice de sa mission pour exécuter les ordres de Dieu.

La biographie du Prophète (saw) qui est venu chez nous a été écrite avec une parfaite objectivité et selon des règles scientifiques. Les biographes ont mis un terme aux faits, comme ils le montraient, en se considérant objectivement, et non par leurs propres sentiments et tendances envers leurs communautés.

Aussi je vous recommande ""Concordance Biblique"" - vous trouver dans mes applications.
Après la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.
Jusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.
La Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues ""originelles"", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.
La version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux.",2015-03-25T02:11:31Z,2023-05-16T00:33:11Z
