In the fast-paced modern life, health management is often ""squeezed out"" by busyness—you can’t find paper and pen when you want to record your blood pressure, lack systematic data when you want to analyze blood glucose changes, and have no way to integrate multiple health indicators. To help you break through these troubles, VitalTide APP comes into being. It integrates the recording of multi-dimensional health indicators such as blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate, and serves as your reliable health partner that you can rely on at any time with simple operations and clear data presentation.
Core Features: Comprehensive Coverage to Make Health Data ""Traceable""
1. Accurate Recording: Every Measurement Has a Clear Record
● Blood Pressure Recording: Adapted to Daily Monitoring Scenarios  
Whether it is the basic blood pressure measurement after getting up in the morning, or irregular monitoring during work breaks, after exercise, etc., the APP has a convenient recording entrance. You can quickly save the data by manually entering the measured values, no complicated operations are required, and it is easy to track the fluctuation trend of blood pressure.
● Blood Glucose Recording: Distinguish Scenarios to Facilitate Diet Analysis  
For blood glucose management needs, an intuitive and easy-to-use dedicated interface is designed: it supports distinguishing between ""pre-meal"" and ""post-meal"" records to help you clearly sort out the correlation between diet and blood glucose changes.
2. Multi-Dimensional Coverage: Meet the Needs of Comprehensive Health Management
In addition to blood pressure and blood glucose, the APP also supports the recording of basic indicators such as heart rate, height and weight, and is also equipped with reference for healthy diet guidelines—from basic physiological data to daily diet suggestions, it covers your health management needs in one stop, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools.
Disclaimer
VitalTide APP is only used as a tool for recording and organizing health data. It cannot replace medical equipment nor provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice. If you have any health discomfort, need to obtain professional medical opinions or make medical decisions, please be sure to consult a practicing doctor to ensure your health and safety.",2025-09-18T07:00:00Z,2025-09-25T01:56:08Z
