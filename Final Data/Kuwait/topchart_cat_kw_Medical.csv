Over the last few years, DASH has proved itself as a trustworthy organization in which patient/family-centered care is provided through a competent and diverse team of health care professionals utilizing the latest technology and applying evidence-based practices. Another significant achievement of DASH is attaining recognized international accreditation and awards from Accreditation Canada and American College of Radiology.

DASH dedication towards development and growth is reflected in the ongoing expansion which will make it the largest private hospital in Kuwait.
