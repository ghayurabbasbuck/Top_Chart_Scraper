How It Works:
The app creates a local on-device server and routes all outgoing HTTPS traffic through it. The app locally generates a trust certificate that should be installed and trusted to securely decrypt HTTPS traffic. When it is done, WebProxyTool captures HTTPS requests, makes dummy leaf certificates for requested domains, and acts as a man-in-the-middle proxy to read network data. Importantly, data is stored only in a local device database, ensuring user privacy, and WebProxyTool developers do not have access to it. The app works without any remote servers involved.

Privacy Statement:
1. The configuration profile and trust certificate are generated and used only locally on your device.
2. The app does not collect any data about the user, the user's device, or other apps used on that device, and thus the app does not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose.
3. The captured HTTPS traffic never leaves your device.
