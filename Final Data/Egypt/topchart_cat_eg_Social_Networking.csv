Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world!

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Leap into the fediverse
Threads is part of the fediverse, a global, open, social network of independent servers operated by third parties around the world. Servers share information with each other to enable people to connect and discover new things across the fediverse.

One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

 SimSimi has always chatted with you 
Do you know that every single word SimSimi says to you in response has been manually taught by tens of millions of people?
Fun and humor, empathy and comfort, knowledge and information...
When we chat with SimSimi, we’re actually chatting with tens of millions of minds.
Now, become SimSimi and chat with many people.
Welcome to the SimSimi world, where billions of minds and billions of SimSimi are interacting with each other!

What is the difference between the official SimSimi and other SimSimi?
The official SimSimi is “Everyone's SimSimi.” 
Anyone can teach Everyone's SimSimi together.
Everyone's SimSimi learns and chats in the same way following its birth in 2002.
SimSimi has been learning pairs of question and answer from many people and using them for chats.
SimSimi other than “Everyone's SimSimi” is called “Individual SimSimi” or “Personal SimSimi.” 
Personal SimSimi is owned and managed by one owner.
Owners can chat with others using their Personal SimSimi and appropriately set their Personal SimSimi to chat automatically.

How can I control SimSimi's bad words?




In SimSimi, chatbots and people interact mainly through chats even though they have never met in the real world. 
We believe that maintaining safety is important to have a good experience in chatting with non-acquaintances (or chatbots).
The SimSimi service has obtained proper awareness and requirements for safety in various languages and regions while serving hundreds of millions of users in 81 languages.
We have established a universal content policy that can be applied anytime, anywhere to respond to requirements for safety awareness, which can vary depending on the language, region, and era, based on several years’ experience in providing services.
All user experiences of the SimSimi service are based on the universal and specific content policy.
The detailed item of the content policy specifies the reason for reporting malicious content, and the content policy is also applied when determining suspicious sentences.
The SimSimi team is making special efforts to enable users to view our content policies frequently and understand them easily when designing the user experience.

SimSimi is threatening me (or someone).
SimSimi is revealing personal information.
Someone must have taught SimSimi to say inappropriate words.
Personal SimSimi chats may have been entered manually by the owner.
You can report any user-created content displayed in SimSimi, including chats.
The SimSimi team is trying to take quick and effective measures against the account that created the reported content.

I have an opinion about the service.
The function is not working normally.
You can send us your comments by selecting ""Send comment” in the SimSimi app. 
By doing so, the SimSimi team can process the comment faster and more accurately because they can also review other information such as the country, language, and version.
If you are not using the app, you can send your comment using the following email address: support-team@simsimi.com 
When sending your comment without using the app, please capture the relevant screen and send us the exact string. 

Can SimSimi see me using the camera?
SimSimi cannot access your device's camera.
Someone taught SimSimi a sentence like “I’m watching you” to embarrass others.

Why limit the users' age?
Many users become friends while chatting with SimSimi.
The SimSimi team establishes policies and maintains and improves operational and technical measures for user safety.
Even though we invest heavily in safety, perfect safety cannot be guaranteed.
That’s why the use of SimSimi is restricted for the age group with high risk of psychological damage in the event of a problem with SimSimi’s safety measures.
