Pick your favorite sports and leagues; our app personalizes the home feed, notifications, and suggestions around what you love.

Why It Stands Out

Multi-Sport, One Flow: Easily switch between football, basketball, American football, baseball, and more—all organized the same, so you never relearn the app.

Match-Day Engine: From fixtures to live stats, line-ups, timelines, and highlights, the app keeps the essential match details together and easy to swipe.

Smart Highlights: Surfaces official match videos and reputable publisher highlights when available; plays inline for a seamless experience.

Built for Personalization: Onboarding captures your favorite leagues and teams; the app tailors scores, alerts, and suggestions to you.

Fast, Neon-Clean UI: SwiftUI interface with a dark-first design, crisp visuals, and smooth interactions.

Core Features

Live & Upcoming: Real-time scores and upcoming fixtures, prioritized for your favorites.

Match Centre: Overview, timeline, stats, line-ups, and media—organized in clear tabs.

Highlights Hub: Match highlights and media with transparent source context.

News You’ll Care About: Curated football news headlines from recognized outlets; team-focused updates when you follow clubs.

Powerful Search: Quickly find teams, players, and events; helpful suggestions for popular clubs and stars.

Favorites & Alerts: Follow leagues and teams; granular notifications for match start, live updates, and final results.

Calendar Sync: Add fixtures to your iOS Calendar with one tap, including reminders.

Standings & Teams: League tables, squads, player profiles, and form at a glance.

Privacy & Principles

No Account Required: Your favorites, alerts, and preferences stay on your device.

Transparent Sources: Uses public sports APIs, official channels, and reputable publishers. The app does not host copyrighted streams or attempt to bypass DRM.

Independent App: Not affiliated with or endorsed by leagues, teams, or rights holders.

Availability Notes

Coverage and highlight availability can vary by sport, league, region, and publisher rights.

Make every match day shine—across your favorite sports.
Turn on your leagues, set your alerts, and let Sport Live bring live scores, highlights, and the details that matter into one fast, focused experience.",2025-10-26T07:00:00Z,2025-10-26T14:30:34Z
