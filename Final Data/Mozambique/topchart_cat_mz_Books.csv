João Ferreira de Almeida
O que se sabe hoje da vida de Almeida está registrado na Dedicatória de um de seus livros e nas atas dos presbitérios de Igrejas Reformadas do Sudeste da Ásia, para as quais trabalhou como pastor, missionário e tradutor, durante a segunda metade do século XVII.
Nascido na cidade de Torres de Tavares, em Portugal, Almeida morreu em 1693 - na Batávia - atual ilha de Java, Indonésia. Com apenas 16 anos, João Ferreira de Almeida dá início à tarefa de tradução da Bíblia, a qual se dedica até o final de sua vida.
Hoje, a tradução Almeida, feita em 1753, se encontra entre nós em diversas versões:
“Versão Antiga”(Sociedade Bíblica Brasileira e outras editoras): por causa da escrupulosa fidelidade aos originais hebraico, aramaico e grego é útil para o estudo, contudo rígida demais para uso litúrgico-catequético.
“Versão Corrigida” (Imprensa Batista): integra correções provindas de manuscritos melhores, atualizando levemente a linguagem.
“Versão atualizada” (Sociedade Bíblica Brasileira): igualmente corrigida com base em melhores manuscritos e atualizada mais corajosamente quanto à linguagem. É a “vulgata” dos protestantes de diversas confissões no Brasil de hoje (Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro 1969). Existem muitas edições, para usos diferentes; vamos mencionar somente a Bíblia “Vida Nova”, provida de bom material de estudo.",2015-03-29T06:07:40Z,2023-03-21T19:03:49Z
