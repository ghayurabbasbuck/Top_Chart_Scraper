Once you have some products created, it’s simple. Choose items from your catalog, add shipping, and then fill in customer details to quickly create an order that syncs with your inventory.

Take payments in person
Collect physical payments using WooCommerce In-Person Payments and a card reader (available in the US and Canada). Start a new order – or find an existing one that’s pending payment – and collect payment using the card reader or a digital wallet, such as Apple Pay.

Get notified of every sale
Now that you’re actively selling, never miss an order or a review. Keep yourself in the loop by enabling real-time alerts – and listen for that addictive “cha-ching” sound that comes with each new sale!

Track sales and bestselling products
See which products are winning at a glance. Keep tabs on your overall revenue, order count, and visitor data by week, month, and year. Knowledge = power.

WooCommerce is the world’s most customizable open-source eCommerce platform. Whether you’re launching a business, taking brick-and-mortar retail online, or developing sites for clients, use WooCommerce for a store that powerfully blends content and commerce.

Requirements: WooCommerce v3.5+.
