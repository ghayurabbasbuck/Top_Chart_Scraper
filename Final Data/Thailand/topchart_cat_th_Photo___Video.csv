Redefine ""retro"" with ""trend""

Every camera has its own color
Each design has its own style
Every photo has its own story

Fomz is a camera app that incorporates trendy elements into retro film.
Each camera theme retains the unique texture of film cameras, but also gives it more meaning and scenes, so that no matter what occasion in your life, there is always a Fomz Film that can fit it.

● Artistic film theme
Just as every camera has a story behind it, every Fomz camera theme will also have its own characteristics and meanings. Different shooting interfaces will bring you a different mood every time you shoot.
● Classic film filter
A selection of classic film filters, each theme is matched with different film grains, time watermarks, light leakage effects, film photo paper and other imaging effects according to the style, so that you will be full of surprises every time you take pictures;
● Document our story
Remember when you were a kid, your parents would write a story about the photo on the back of the photo you developed? Sometimes it's a ""small diary"", sometimes it's a sentence, sometimes it's just a special date... These are all treasured records about that moment in the photo. Fomz deliberately kept this ""old tradition"", as long as the back of the photo was turned upside down, he could write a written record about the photo.

""We record frequently because life is worth it.""
Text and photos are the most convenient and direct way to record life
I hope that Fomz can go through the romance of the world with you and taste the bitters and sweets of life
