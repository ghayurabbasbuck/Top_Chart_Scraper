The resolution calculator helps you to calculate a resolution by filling in the other side, according to your set ratio. Editing the set ratio is as simple as a tap, too. When choosing your scale, you can either put in a standard fraction like 16:9, or put in a resolution you want to scale up or down while keeping the same aspect.

And when you've got a resolution you want to save, just tap Add Preset to save it with a custom name. You can edit your presets at any time.

Resolutioner supports iPhone, iPad, and Mac. All of your saved presets sync over iCloud, too.",2021-05-11T07:00:00Z,2021-05-12T04:27:49Z

### Features

- Directly Capture & Inspect HTTP/HTTPS from your iOS/iPad Devices without using MacBooks.
- Decrypt and View HTTP/HTTPS Request/Response in plain text
- JSON Syntax Highlighting
- Exclusively designed for iPhone and iPad (Landscape and Two Columns)
- Share traffic to Proxyman macOS - a native macOS app for better inspection
- Pin working domains
- Quick filter with URL, Header Body, and Type of Request/Response (e.g., JSON, Form, HTML, CSS, Document, etc)
- Better Request/Response Previewer: Multiple columns, JSON Preview, JSON TreeView, etc
- Safe Lock: Protect your sensitive data with FaceID / TouchID / Passcode
- Advanced Debugging Tools: SSL Proxying, Block List, Map Local, Breakpoint, etc

### Proxyman macOS
Proxyman for iOS works perfectly with Proxyman for macOS (native macOS app, supports macOS 26 and M4 Chip)

### How it works

Proxyman iOS creates a local VPN on your device and then forwards all traffic to a Local Man-in-The-Middle Server. As long as the VPN is active, Proxyman iOS can capture all traffic over Wi-Fi and cellular Data.

### How about my sensitive data?

- Proxyman Root Certificate is a self-signed certificate that is generated on your local machine. Thus, all requests and responses are captured and stored on your devices and Proxyman does not have access to your data. 
- There are no remote servers involved. What’s in your devices, it’s in your devices.
