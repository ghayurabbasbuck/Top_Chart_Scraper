If lightning strikes in your area (by default within 30 km radius), the app will send you a notification with information about how far from you the lightning struck. You can thus take shelter in time.

iRadar - precise precipitation radar
In the app you can track the progress of precipitation from Germany to Ukraine and from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic. You can find out where the precipitation is, when it will reach you or, conversely, when it will stop.

Current weather conditions

Zobrazí nejen aktuální srážky nad Českem, ale i jejich předpověď na následující hodinu. Nechybí ani údaje o aktuálních teplotách, větru, srážkách nebo stavu počasí. Meteoradar umožňuje sledovat vývoj počasí téměř v reálném čase. Data jsou aktualizována každých 10 minut.

* Údaje z meteostanic
Na mapě jsou dostupné údaje z více než 150 meteorologických stanic. Meteorologické stanice zaznamenávají teplotu, vítr, srážky ale i vlhkost nebo tlak vzduchu. U každé stanice je v grafu uveden vývoj teploty.

* Blesky
V případě bouřek aplikace zobrazí i místa, kde uhodil blesk. Na základě radarového snímku potom poznáte, jak se bude bouřka nadále vyvíjet.

* Meteozprávy
Aplikace zobrazuje informace o počasí přímo od uživatelů, kteří sledují počasí v daných místech.

* Přidávejte informace o počasí
Aplikace umožňuje zasílat informace o počasí ve vaší lokalitě. Pokud se u vás vyskytuje například silná bouřka, stačí v aplikaci vytvořit hlášení o počasí, které si následně přečtou stovky lidí. Přidat můžete aktuální fotografii či popis počasí. Ostatní lidi tak varujete před nepříznivým počasím, které panuje ve vašem městě a pravděpodobně zasáhne i další.
