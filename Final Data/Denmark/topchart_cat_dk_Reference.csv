Søge mulighederne administreres af de kirkegårde der bidrager med data.
På oversigtskortet er det muligt at se hvilke kirkegårde app'en kan benyttes på.
Det er muligt at se aktuelle takster for kirkegårdens ydelser, kontaktoplysninger og adresse.
Gravsteder kan søges frem ved hjælp af afdødes navne.
Søgeresultat vil blive vist som afdødes navn, fødsels og dødsdato samt nr. på gravsted. Er gravstedets placering angivet på et kirkegårdskort vil placeringen kunne vises på app'ens kort.
