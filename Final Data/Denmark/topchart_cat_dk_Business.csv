Jobindex formidler alle slags jobannoncer direkte fra virksomhederne uden at ændre i tekst, fotos eller andre oplysninger i stillingsbeskrivelsen.

Review from eCommerce News HQ
“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“

Review from David B via g2.com
“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”
