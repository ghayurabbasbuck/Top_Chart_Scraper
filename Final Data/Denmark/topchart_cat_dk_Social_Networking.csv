Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world!

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Leap into the fediverse
Threads is part of the fediverse, a global, open, social network of independent servers operated by third parties around the world. Servers share information with each other to enable people to connect and discover new things across the fediverse.

Share daily moments through Status

Share your everyday life with those who matter. With Status you can share text, photos, video, and GIF updates that disappear after 24 hours. You're always in control of who sees your status. Just choose who you want to share it with - all your contacts or selected ones. And bring your everyday to life.

One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

Brug opslagstavlen til at spørge nabolaget og arrangér feriehjælp. Det er Nabohjælps app i en maggi-terning.


Vær med i Nabohjælp, hvis du vil være en del af det mest veldokumenterede redskab mod indbrud. En indbrudstyv vælger gerningssted ud fra tilgængelighed, tegn på værdier og tegn på liv. I sær det sidste virker afskrækkende og derfor forebygger aktiv Nabohjælp op mod hvert 4. indbrud. Samtidig er Nabohjælp med til at skabe tryghed og trivsel gennem naboskab i nabolaget.


Appen gør Nabohjælp i dit nabolag officielt og effektivt.


KORTVISNING AF NABOLAGET
Få kort over alle tilmeldte nabohjælpere i dit nabolag. Bestem selv hvordan du definerer dit nabolag og dermed hvem, du modtager advarsler og spørgsmål fra.


ADVARSLER
Skriv, læs og kommentér på advarsler om mistænkelig adfærd eller indbrud i nabolaget. Få besked hvis der er forhøjet risiko for indbrud i dit nabolag. Tilmeld dig særlig rådgivning, når der er forhøjet risiko for indbrud i dit nabolag og få forslag til forskellige aktiviteter, som gør du og dine naboer synlige i nabolaget, mens risikoen er forhøjet – samtidig med at I bygger naboskab


SPØRG NABOLAGET PÅ NABOLAGETS OPSLAGSTAVLE
Skriv læs og kommentér på spørgsmål til nabolaget. Fx hvis du vil tilbyde andre at låne din trailer, eller selv har brug for en anbefaling til barnepige. Her er plads til alt, hvad naboskabet rummer


FERIEHJÆLP
Invitér betroede nabohjælpere som feriehjælpere via kort eller e-mail. Opret dine ferier og giv besked til feriehjælperne, så de får påmindelser, mens du er afsted. Få alt-ok beskeder fra feriehjælperne, mens du er væk og få påmindelser og gode råd, når du selv skal feriehjælpe.


NABOVEN
Som naohjælper kan du vælge at oprette dig som Naboven, hvis der mangler en i dit nabolag. 


En Naboven er en særligt dedikeret nabohjælper, som gør noget ekstra for at få effektiv Nabohjælp i hele nabolaget. I sær ved at arbejde med aktiviteter, som skaber relationer mellem naboerne. Og ved at koordinere en fælles indsats ifm. indbrud. Du kan melde dig som Naboven for dit nabolag i Nabohjælps app, eller du kan kontakte din Naboven, hvis du har brug for et godt råd eller ønsker at bidrage til fælles aktiviteter i dit nabolag. Læs meget mere på nabohjaelp.dk/naboven/tilmeld/



OPRETTELSE SOM NABOHJÆLPER OG NABOVEN
For at bruge appen og være med i Nabohjælp skal du oprette en profil på appen. Alle nabohjælpere MitID-valideres og adressevalideres via MitID eller brev som en del af sikkerheden. Når du er oprettet, sender vi dig et velkomstbrev med klistermærker. Du kan tilføje to adresser til din profil, fx din folkeregisteradresser og dit sommerhus.



Som nabohjælper kan du også oprette dig som Naboven for dit nabolag, hvis der ikke er en i forvejen. Så sender vi en velkomstpakkn med ID-kort, materialer og andre gode sager. Og du får din egen kommunikationskanal i appen, ligesom du får et netværk med andre Nabovenner i landet.


TILGÆNGELIGHEDSERKLÆRING
Hos Nabohjælp gør vi vores bedste for at drifte og udvikle en anvendelig og tilgængelig App for så mange borgere som muligt. Du finder vores tilgængelighedserklæring her: https://www.was.digst.dk/app-nabohj%C3%A6lp

• Share them out as photos or use our video recap feature to stitch together the memories of you and your friends, capturing those “love it” moments.
