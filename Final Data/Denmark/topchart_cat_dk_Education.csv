Stop Scrolling Social Media -> Download Deepstash -> Use it for 5 min/day -> Become the smartest in the room.

Join 3 Million+ smart people to discover new ideas, learn new things, improve yourself and inspire others.

Knowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.

Ideas are created by users just like you. Whenever you read a book, article or listen to a podcast and find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, you can add an idea about it in Deepstash. You see the source of the idea right in your feed.

What to do with ideas? They are fundamental to your wellbeing, success in life or your career. Ideas can make you:
- Smarter (you'll know more stuff, doh!)
- More Creative (you can connect more dots)
- Happier (better habits, less anxiety)

Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.

PERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS

Choose a few topics of interest and directions (like increasing productivity, building better habits or earning more money) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.

The more you read and save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.

BUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

You can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.

Search and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes.

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Add your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.

Share your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this.
