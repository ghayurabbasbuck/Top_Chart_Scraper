Både køber og sælger skal have appen installeret og logge ind med NemID/MitID. Derefter kan de i samarbejde gennemføre ejerskiftet af køretøjet, så den nye ejer bliver registreret i Motorregistret.  

Når både køber og sælger har downloadet appen og logget ind med NemID/MitID, fungerer appen sådan, at:
•	Sælger ser en oversigt over sine køretøjer og vælger at påbegynde omregistrering af gældende køretøj. Dette danner en kode, der gives til køber. 
•	Køber ser en oversigt over sine eventuelle køretøjer og vælger at tilføje et nyt køretøj. Herefter indtastes koden, der er modtaget fra sælger og gældende køretøj identificeres. Når køber har valgt ansvars- og evt. kaskoforsikring, betales et gebyr for ejerskiftet på 340 kr. Hvis køber allerede har en aftale med et forsikringsselskab, kan der indtastes et forsikringsbevisnummer.
•	Når ejerskiftet er gennemført, modtager både køber og sælger en kvittering på overdragelsen der altid kan findes i appen. 

Når du bruger Ejerskifte, skal du være opmærksom på, at:
•	Du skal være fyldt 18 år for at logge ind.
•	Du skal have et dansk cpr-nummer. 
•	Hvis der er gæld i køretøjet, overtages dette af den nye ejer. Gæld i køretøjet kan tjekkes på tinglysning.dk.
•	Der skal være et gyldigt syn på køretøjet før det kan omregistreres. 
•	Det er lovpligtigt at have ansvarsforsikring på sit køretøj, derfor vælges dette i appen. 
•	Køber skal betale et gebyr på 340 kr. for at gennemføre ejerskiftet. 
•	Det ikke er muligt at angive andre end dig selv som primær bruger af køretøjet. Det er heller ikke muligt at tilføje sekundære brugere eller sekundære ejere. Disse oplysninger kan ændres eller tilføjes i Motorregistret for et gebyr på 340 kr.
•	Når koden er dannet, har køber en time til at gennemføre ejerskiftet.

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.",2015-05-30T09:25:44Z,2025-11-13T23:54:23Z
