There’s no longer just a dial to twist when your favourite song comes on, then guard to make sure no one else touches it. With the app, you can crank up the volume from the kitchen and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. 

It’s using the powers of technology for good, and ultimately with you in control, better playlists for all. And if apps aren’t your thing, you can still use our products without it. 

Using the app is simple. Just connect your devices, adjust the volume, and get on with your life. You can fiddle with more detailed adjustments if you’re that way inclined, like equalisers and noise control for headphones – everything is there to help create your perfect fit.
