Hinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.

HOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE
When it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:

* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.

* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.

* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.

* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.

* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.

The app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.

Of course, we understand that switching to a new app can be annoying, but we promise: handling your smart lights is even easier with SMART+ from now!
To show you what to expect, we have summarized the smart features for you below:
Flexible lighting
A flexible lighting mode allows you to adjust brightness, color temperature or even the colors of your smart lights according to your respective needs. You can set different moods thanks to pre-installed light scenes but an individual modification is also possible.
Schedules & Automations
With the help of the new SMART+ app, you can set up different schedules and automations: You are watching TV at the same time every day and want to switch off the ceiling light to do so? No problem! Once set, your smart devices will automatically repeat this action every day by themselves.
Smart lighting for your daily routine & circadian rhythm
Whether waking up in the morning or going to bed in the evening – with some of the LEDVANCE products you can easily define a sunrise alarm with fade-in or fade-out lighting via app. Also super helpful: Light similar to natural daylight can help improve physical well-being. Based on this scientific finding, you can adjust the light color and brightness of certain luminaires to your individual daily routine - for calmer sleep and a better mood.
Adaptation to light conditions
If the sun is shining, you usually need little to no additional light. If it is cloudy, on the other hand, artificial light is needed to brighten up the room. By linking to weather information, your lighting independently adjusts to the current natural lighting conditions.
Integration with other smart home systems
Do you already use Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, Home Connect Plus or Amazon Alexa? The combination of the SMART+ app with these systems offers you additional features for many end devices - for example, voice control. The app even supports 27 languages here.
Grouping lamps
With the new SMART+ app, it is possible to organize several lamps into groups and control them simultaneously. For example, you can set all your outdoor lights to turn on together.
Power consumption 
If you use Wifi sockets for your smart lighting or other devices, you can view the energy consumption at any time with the help of our app – that's good for the environment and your wallet!
Solar lights control
Solar lights usually turn on by themselves. However, our smart solar products can also be conveniently controlled using the new SMART+ app.
Camera and sensor control
Do you use smart outdoor lights with integrated cameras or sensors? Thanks to the SMART+ app, you'll receive live images and notifications when your lights detect movement.
Music function
With the help of the app and integrated voice receivers, some lights respond to sound and music – so the next party will be great!
Integration of non-smart devices into the system
You want to control a non-smart light via our app? Thanks to the SMART+ Plug, even conventional lights and devices can be integrated into your smart home system and controlled via the SMART+ app.
Note: Please note that some functions of the app only work with WiFi or Bluetooth devices. Zigbee devices are not compatible with this app.
As you can see, the new SMART+ app offers many functions around smart lighting and beyond. The future belongs to smart home systems. LEDVANCE therefore offers you a wide range of smart lighting solutions for indoors and outdoors to pair with the app. These solutions are not only extremely efficient, but also visually appealing . Whether smart ceiling lights, LED lamps or LED strips –  at SMART+ you will surely find what you are looking for.",2023-07-04T07:00:00Z,2025-10-31T10:06:00Z

Control and manage your smart appliances anytime, anywhere

Did I switch off the oven? Instead of heading back home to check, simply take a look at the app. You will see and be able to control the status of your appliances straight away with immediate access to important functionalities, whether at home or on the go.

Be aware of all that’s important

Oh, the fridge door has been left open? When do I need to descale the coffee machine? How often should I clean the oven? Important notifications and reminders regarding maintenance and care will be sent to you automatically. And even if things don’t go to plan: by using remote diagnostics our customer service team will help you resolve any issue. You can also simply check the manual which is conveniently stored in the app.

Voice-control your appliances via Amazon Alexa, or Google Home

Whether it’s making coffee, preheating the oven, or starting the washing machine: Voice your command and Amazon Alexa or Google Home will take care of the rest. What’s more, you can use predefined or individual routines for recurring tasks to orchestrate your smart home, like having your coffee made at the same time each working day.

Finding the best programme and other little helpers

Dishwasher, dryer, or oven – depending on the appliance and task at hand, you will be recommended the ideal programme and settings, whether it’s a pile of dirty dishes, a load of washing, or the cheesecake recipe for your next family reunion. Based on your feedback, programmes can even improve over time to better fit your needs. And with Coffee Playlist you can conveniently fulfil your guests’ coffee requests to match that cheesecake.

Let your oven do the work

Don’t want to keep checking whether your dish is ready? Simply set the desired browning level for the selected dish and start the oven. Artificial Intelligence evaluates the browning level based on images taken by the integrated camera. The oven switches off as soon as the selected level is reached. The camera also lets you check your dish from anywhere on your smartphone.
