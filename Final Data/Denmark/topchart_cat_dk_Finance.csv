Du ved den der app, der gør betaling meget, meget nemt: Send penge til en ven (eller én, du ikke kender, hvis du er mere til det), betal i butikker, på nettet eller i andre apps. Og det er langt fra det eneste, du kan.

Du kan også bruge MobilePay til at: 
• anmode om penge
• modtage penge
• betale dine regninger
• have faste betalingsaftaler
• dele udgifter i en gruppe
• samle penge ind med box
• sende pengegaver (på planlagte tidspunkter) pakket ind i digitalt gavepapir

Fik vi sagt, at det er helt sikkert at sende penge og betale med MobilePay? Hvis ikke det er meget, meget nemt, ja, så ved vi snart ikke …

Det eneste, du skal have (udover lov af dine forældre, hvis du er under 18), er et betalingskort fra og en konto i en dansk bank – og så et telefonnummer, en e-mailadresse og MitID.

Og husk, at appen her kun er lavet til privat brug – så nu ikke noget med at lege butik :) Men hvis du gerne vil bruge os til det, så kan du selvfølgelig også det – så skal du bare have en erhvervsaftale. Det kan du heldigvis meget nemt få. Læs mere om det og meget andet på mobilepay.dk.

MobilePay er lavet i Norden med kærlighed for forenkling, så den er selvfølgelig tilgængelig på både dansk, engelsk, svensk, finsk og to slags norsk.",2013-05-06T13:41:03Z,2025-11-17T18:04:41Z

Ved hjælp af en sikret adgang til Skattestyrelsens oplysninger og dine input, kan Skatteguiden hjælpe dig med undgå skattesmæk, finde glemte fradrag, tjekke årsopgørelsen før alle andre, og løbende holde styr på din indkomst. Hvis du er studerende, kan du også holde styr på, hvornår du tjener for meget ved siden af SU'en og undgå SU-smæk.

OM SKATTEGUIDEN
Skatteguiden er en højteknologisk virksomhed med ét enkelt formål - at gøre personlig skat nemt og overskueligt for os alle. Derfor har vi lavet dit automatiske skatteunivers, der giver dig ro omkring dine skatteforhold.

-

FORSKUDS TRACKER
Vi hjælper dig automatisk med at betale den rette skat og få de rette rentefradrag gennem hele året, således du ikke får et ubehageligt skattesmæk, men i stedet har ro omkring dine skatter.

TOPSKAT TRACKER
Få et løbende overblik over, hvor meget du har tjent ift. topskattegrænsen samt hvornår det kan give mening for dig, at indbetale mere til din pensionsordning for at opnå en skattebesparelse.

GLEMTE FRADRAG
Mange mennesker betaler for meget i skat, da ikke alle fradrag indberettes automatisk. Vi hjælper dig med at finde glemte fradrag op til 3 år tilbage i tid. Efterfølgende foretager vi indberetningen til Skattestyrelsen, så du får dine penge udbetalt direkte til din NemKonto.

SU TRACKER
Tjener man for meget ved siden af sin SU, risikerer man et SU-smæk og skal betale SU tilbage. Skatteguidens SU Tracker sammenholder dine løn- og SU-forhold løbende, så du kan undgå at betale SU tilbage. Alt sammen i et let tilgængeligt overblik.

INDKOMSTOVERBLIK
Hold løbende styr på, hvor meget du har tjent igennem året, hvad du betaler i skat, hvad du indbetaler til pension, hvornår du skal betale topskat og meget mere. Hele din indkomst samlet i ét simpelt overblik.

MIN SKAT I SAMFUNDET
Op imod 50% af din indkomst går til skat - men ved du reelt set, hvad dine skattekroner bruges på? Vi har bundet din skat sammen med de offentlige budgetter, så du kan se ned til sidste krone, hvad dine skattekroner er blevet brugt på.

TIDLIG ÅRSOPGØRELSE
Skatteguiden kan give dig et estimat af dit årsopgørelsesresultat op til 5 uger før Skat leverer den endelige årsopgørelse. Få et overblik over hvilket beløb du bør indbetale til Skat, for at spare renterne på en eventuel restskat. Vi leverer den endelige årsopgørelses PDF direkte i app'en.

Life is charming. Especially when it hits you with bills and changes and leaves no room for your finances to keep up. Sounds familiar? Yeah, we thought it would.

AND SOMETIMES THEY’RE EASY
That’s why we’ve done our very best to create a new way of paying that accommodates just that. One that doesn’t require you to pay 100% of the price at checkout. One that lets you slice.

IN CASE THEY’RE NOT
Our team in customer service is happy to help you Monday to Thursday 8-17 and Fridays 8-15.

SHOP
A bed. A stroller. A new pair of shoes. Browse our partner shops, find your favorites, and fill your basket. 3000+ shoppers sign up/join our community every month. That’s not nothing.

AND SLICE
Proceed to checkout, slice your payment in 4, and chill. Our partner shops are paying for you to have that option. How’s that for customer service?

IT’S SIMPLE
Pay 25% today and 75% over the next three months, automatically. If for some reason, a pot of gold drops into your lap, you can make a manual payment and just be done with it.

BECAUSE
The Buy-Now-Pay-Later culture was getting a bit, yeah you know. And so we decided to shake things up a bit and see if we could do better. Turns out we could. We’ve developed a business model where shops pay a transaction fee of 3.95% as a service to their shoppers. As a result, shoppers pay nothing for paying in slices.

WE GOT YOU
We’ll remind you when it’s time to pay the next installment. We’ll make sure your account is updated with an overview of your payments. We’ll send you an email confirmation every time an order has been approved.

BIG TIME
Don’t take our word for it. We’re not the ones doing the shopping. Trust the reviews. That’s what we do.",2022-09-30T07:00:00Z,2025-11-19T04:21:31Z
