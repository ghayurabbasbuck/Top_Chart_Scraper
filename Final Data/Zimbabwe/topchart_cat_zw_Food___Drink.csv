The premium version allows you to:

1. Generate unlimited recipes from dish photos, ingredient scans, and chat.
2. Access unlimited cooking sessions with live AI assistance.
3. Use unlimited photo analysis for cooking feedback.

You can start a 3-day free trial to access these premium features. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial,
you will be automatically charged the price indicated on the payment screen for your chosen subscription period. The SousChef AI Premium
subscription renews automatically at the end of each period until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal
will be disabled. However, you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current
period. Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.",2025-09-17T07:00:00Z,2025-11-19T18:38:00Z
