Sounds good, right? Never again will you have to wonder who‘s on the other end of the line – Call ID -  Call Blocker will take care of all your unwanted and unknown calls and messages. Simply enjoy your life without distractions.

Call ID -  Call Blocker is an amazing tool that will help you:

IDENTIFY CALLER-ID INSTANTLY
Call Blocker immediately tells you whether the person calling you is one of your contacts or possibly a blacklisted number from the database. The app offers you Caller ID lookup, showing your business information instead of only the usual location. You can choose which action to take and get rid of phone spammers forever!

BLOCK ALL UNWANTED CALLERS
Block all those unwanted numbers - robocalls, auto calls, telemarketers, and other scam callers. Be the one who decides which calls and messages are worth your attention.

CHOOSE BLOCK OR IDENTIFY FOR EVERY CATEGORY
The app shows you caller ID or blocks calls automatically based on your preferences. You can choose a different setting for each category for the database - so block spam, scam, and telemarketing calls but let the app identify trustworthy numbers or unknown callers.

PROTECT YOUR INCOMING MESSAGES
From now on, you can filter your incoming text messages with keywords. The app will detect the entered keyword in your texts and filter it into a junk folder.

USE THE UP-TO-DATE DATABASE
The app compares all your calls with the numbers in our database. The database is updated regularly to ensure your privacy and security. We deal with unwanted numbers so you don’t have to.

ADD NUMBERS TO THE DATABASE
Add numbers of unwanted callers to a user-shared database. We’ve got your privacy covered and will never share any of your contacts with the list.

CREATE YOUR OWN BLACKLIST
Decide what to do with unwanted callers. Do you want to block them from ever calling you? Or do you want to leave them access but be warned when their number comes up? Or do you want to deal with each number individually? It's all up to your decision.

REVERSE LOOKUP AND SEARCH NUMBERS
You can also compare any missed calls from unknown numbers with the database list and find out the identity of the caller easily.

BACK UP YOUR BLACKLIST
Back up your blacklist and access it easily by signing into your account and sharing it across all your devices.
