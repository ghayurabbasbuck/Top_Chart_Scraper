The Apocrypha is a collection of ancient biblical books that were included in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV) but were later removed in 1885. These texts were originally positioned between the Old Testament and the New Testament, alongside maps and genealogies. Some of these books are also known as Deuterocanonical books, a term used by the Catholic Church and other Christian traditions.

The 70 missing verses of 2 Esdras, which are not included in the King James Version Apocrypha, can be found in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha, edited by Howard C. Kee, and in the NRSV Holy Bible with Apocrypha, published by Oxford University Press.

Should the Apocrypha Be in the Bible?
The Apocrypha has been a subject of debate for centuries. Some argue these books were never part of the inspired Word of God, citing verses such as Tobit 6:5-8, which mentions magic, as inconsistent with the rest of the Bible. Others believe the Apocrypha was wrongly removed, pointing out that these books were included in the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before being taken out just over a century ago. Some claim that they were excluded due to their absence from the original Hebrew manuscripts, while others argue that publishers removed them to reduce printing costs.

Interestingly, fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, dating back to before 70 A.D., contain portions of Apocryphal books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit, suggesting that these texts were valued in early Jewish communities.

My Mafia husband slept with the woman who killed our baby, and his sister filmed it.  
I tipped off the FBI about his crimes and fled his insane mob family.  
Now, he's locked down the entire city just to hunt me down. 

The Pack's Doctor
Yara is a werewolf, hiding in a human university, studying medicine. One day, when Yara is out letting her wolf run, she comes across Alpha Warren, caught in a bear trap. She saves him, but surprisingly finds out he was her mate.  Warren, a strong and powerful Alpha, finally finds his mate. He's unwilling to let her go, so he took Yara to his pack.
