Available on the iPhone and Apple Watch, Pedometer++ is the best way to review your step count, walking distance, active calories, and heart rate data. 

Set a custom step count goal, and track your progress over time. The built-in graphs make reviewing your data easy and fun. Everyone loves awards, and Pedometer++ includes a range of Badges to motivate and reward your hard work! The app also totals how far you’ve walked each day, and even counts the flights of stairs you encounter each day.

With full-featured widget support, Pedometer++ can display your step count or update you on your daily progress right from your iPhone's lock screen or home screen. You can also share your workouts with others and view trends over time.

The Apple Watch app puts all this data on your wrist. With a wide range of Complications, it’s easy to check your progress with just a glance. Add a single Complication to your daily watch face, or add several to build a comprehensive fitness-focused look! 

DETAILS:
For best results, keep your iPhone on you as you move throughout the day, ideally in a pocket close to your hips. If you have an Apple Watch, you can set Pedometer++ to sync step data across your devices for the most accurate data possible.

The Apple Watch app can also start and track indoor and outdoor walking and running workouts and can serve as your guide while hiking.


ROUTES & MAPPING:
Pedometer++ is your ultimate companion for exploring the great outdoors. It allows you to import GPX files for waypoints and routes set by others. 

You can also use the app to create your own routes. Simply tap on your desired start and end points, and Pedometer++ will find the shortest route between them. You can then tweak the route based on terrain, trail popularity, or personal preference. 

Pedometer++ shows the distance of a route, the elevation changes you will encounter, and the estimated time it will take you to reach your destination. You can also monitor the weather that is expected along your route.

The best part is that custom routing is available on the iPhone and Apple Watch. Of course, being out in nature often means losing cell service, so Pedometer++ allows you to download offline map data for large areas, not just for your specific route. Offline map data is also available on the iPhone and Apple Watch, as long as your Watch is within range of your phone.


NOTES:
Pedometer++ integrates with the Apple Health app to collect and display step data collected by your Apple Watch. 

Pedometer++ includes an optional premium subscription. This is offered on a monthly or annual basis. If you choose to purchase a subscription, your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. After purchase, you can turn off auto-renewal anytime by going to your Account Settings on the App Store.

Access to iPhone-based workout tracking is only available to Pedometer++ Premium subscribers.

Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.
- The subscription automatically renews. The renewal cost will be charged to your account 24 hours before the end of the current subscription, if auto-renewal has not been turned off.
- You can easily manage subscriptions in your Apple account settings – for example, turn off automatic subscription renewal right after purchase.

FROM THE APP'S CREATOR 

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!


Growing up is not easy! But we support parents and children every day on this exciting journey.

IS IT EFFECTIVE?
It’s proven that this healthy lifestyle leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's ""fat-burning"" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.

IS IT SAFE?
Yes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

CAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?
With various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women. It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it.
