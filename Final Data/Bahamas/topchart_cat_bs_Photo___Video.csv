Recording to Blackmagic Cloud Storage lets you collaborate on DaVinci Resolve projects with editors anywhere in the world, all at the same time!

Get the ""Hollywood Look"" with Digital Film!
Blackmagic Camera puts the professional features you need for feature film, television and documentaries in your pocket.

Best of all, recording to Blackmagic Cloud allows you to get your footage to the newsroom or post production studio in minutes.

Interactive Controls for Fast Setup 
Blackmagic Camera has all the controls you need to quickly setup and start shooting!  Everything is interactive, so you can tap any item and instantly change settings without searching through confusing menus! The HUD shows status and record parameters, histogram, focus peaking indicators, levels, frame guides and more. Show or hide the HUD by swiping up or down. You can auto focus by tapping the screen in the area you want to focus. You can shoot in 16:9 or vertical aspect ratios, plus you can shoot 16:9 while holding your phone vertically if you want to shoot unobtrusively.

On Screen Heads Up Display
The heads up display, or HUD, controls have the most important camera controls such as lens selection, frame rate, shutter angle, timecode, ISO, white balance, gain and audio levels. You can adjust settings such as exposure by touching the ISO indicator, or you can change the audio levels simply by touching the audio meters. Everything is interactive, so if you tap any item you can instantaneously change its settings without having to search through complex menus!

Camera Setup Menus
The settings tab unlocks the full power of your phone’s camera, with quick access to advanced settings such as monitoring, audio, camera setup, recording and more!

Media
The Blackmagic Camera media tab has all the controls you need to browse or scrub clips for quick review, search and sort and view the upload status of your media. Access your media from Blackmagic Camera’s all clips folder by choosing the Media button to see the thumbnails for each clip you have stored.

SUPPORTED STREAMING DEVICES

Web Video Caster® supports the most popular streaming devices, allowing your TV to stream videos directly from the web.

• Google Cast (Chromecast, Android TV, Chromecast built-in)
• DLNA devices like Xbox, Samsung TVs, LG TVs, etc. 
• Roku, Roku stick and Roku TVs

*Your streaming device must be capable of decoding the video you are playing. Web Video Caster doesn't perform any video/audio decoding or transcoding.

HOW IT WORKS

Web Video Cast™ is a browser, which allows you to stream videos of movies, TV shows, and other media from the internet to a streaming device or smart tv. Web Video Caster grabs the video URL inside the web page, sends it to the streaming device (i.e. Chromecast or DLNA device), and then plays the video directly from the content provider. This ultimately saves your mobile device’s battery. It also detects subtitles on the web page. Web Video Cast™ does not host these videos. This is not a mirroring app.


GET STARTED

Follow these simple step-by-step instructions to start streaming:

1. Find a video online that you want to watch.

2. Make sure this video can play on mobile browsers without Flash.

3. Connect to your streaming device.

4. Play the video as you normally would. Or, click the play button on the toolbar.

LIMITATIONS & DISCLOSURES

As with all apps, there are some limitations we are aware of and want you to know about up front.

• We are in no way associated with any web media providers and we do not have control over the content they provide.
• Web Video Caster does not support nor play Flash or FLV videos.
• The app does not support tab casting, like the Chromecast extension for the PC web browser.
• We cannot do anything to fix issues that arise on the server side (media content provider) such as failure to play or buffering, which is especially common during heavy load times and weekends.
