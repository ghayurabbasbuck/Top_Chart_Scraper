HOW DOES IT WORK?

ReciMe includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.

The premium version allows you to:

1.	Download unlimited recipes from social media, and

2.	Upload unlimited private recipes to your private recipe collection.

You can start a 7-day free trial to access these premium features. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged the price indicated on the payment screen for your chosen subscription period. The ReciMe Premium subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each month or year) until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal will be disabled. However, you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period. Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.
