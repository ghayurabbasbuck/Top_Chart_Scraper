Along with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.

Through our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.

**The I Am Sober app features:**

To visualize how long you’ve been sober.

• Remember why you quit
Add reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.

• Sobriety calculator
View how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.

• Analyze triggers
Recap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.

• Withdrawal timeline
When you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.

• Customize your experience
You set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.

**Sober Plus subscriptions**

I Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:

GoWish is your digital wishlist, where you can create and save all your wishes in one place. Download the GoWish app, create a profile, and add wishes that you can easily share with all your friends. The app makes it easy for your friends and family to reserve and purchase your wishes.

With the app, you can create your gift wishes wherever you are. You can add wishes to your wishlists from any online store in the world - there are no limitations.

Also, use the app to keep track of things you need to remember to buy for yourself.
It has never been easier to share a wishlist than with the GoWish app. Share wishlists with your friends using the app, share via SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger, email, or one of your other favorite media.

Avoid duplicate gifts:
One of the significant advantages of using the app is that you won't receive duplicate gifts for birthdays, Christmas, confirmations, weddings, etc. Your guests can see what is being reserved by other guests - without you, of course, being able to see it yourself.
You can use the GoWish app, or you can use GoWish through your browser. As a user, you always have your wishlist at hand. Easy and simple.

Super easy to use:
If you come across something you want, you can save it in two ways.

If it's on a website, you can save your wish directly with a single click on the wish button in your share-menu on your iPhone or iPad.
You can also copy the link to your gift wish and then go to the app and press ""create wish automatically,"" paste the link, and the app takes care of the rest :)

We recommend that you use one of the two automatic methods to create your wishes, making it super easy for your friends to find and buy exactly what you want.

Organise your smart lights
Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home.

Easily control your lights — from anywhere
Use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection. 

Explore the Hue scene gallery
Created by professional lighting designers, the scenes in the scene gallery can help you set the mood for any occasion. You can even create your own scenes based on a photo or your favourite colours. 
 
Set up bright home security 
Make your home feel safer, no matter where you are. The Security Centre lets you programme your Secure cameras, Secure contact sensors and indoor motion sensors to send you alerts when they detect activity. Trigger light and sound alarms, call the authorities or a trusted contact, and monitor your home in real-time.

Get the best light for any moment of the day
Let your lights change automatically throughout the day with the Natural light scene — so you feel more energised, focused, relaxed or rested at the right times. Just set the scene to watch your lights change with the sun’s movement, transitioning from cool blue tones in the morning to warmer, relaxing hues for sunset. 

Automate your lights
Make your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customisable automations in the Philips Hue app is effortless. 

Sync your lights to TV, music and games
Make your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten and change colour in sync with your screen or sound! With the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box, the Philips Hue Sync for TV or desktop apps or Spotify, you can create totally immersive experiences.

Set up voice control
Use Apple Home, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with voice commands. Turn lights on and off, dim and brighten or even change colours — completely hands-free.

Use Siri Shortcuts for quick control
Use the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature or set scenes – all without even opening the app.
