No surprises on the road
Get detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. 
It also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.

There’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.
Plan a route with 4-10 stops and tap ""Optimize."" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.

Get your bearings anywhere

Look for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.

Pay for fuel
Choose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.

Turn on ""Avoid bad and unpaved roads"" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.

Plan your trips ahead of time
Adjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.
For example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.

Get directions tailored to your vehicle
If you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select ""Add truck"" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.

Monitor traffic in real time

The application will do everything for you – just specify your preferences in the settings, the algorithm will select the best option.

Request for support. Need help on the way? Create an application for escort, specifying the meeting place and destination, and our employees of the Passenger Mobility Center (TSOMP) will do the rest.
