Ақлли илова орқали қулай нархларда такси буюртма қилинг.

Fasten – янги такси буюртма қилиш хизматини кутиб олинг. У билан сафарлар ёқимли ва фойдали одатга айланади.

Fasten сафарлар нархини олдиндан кўрсатади ва арзонроқ нархда кетиш учун бир неча дақиқа пиёда юриш керак бўлган жойгача олиб борадиган муқобил нуқталарни топа олади. Шунингдек, сиз йўлда бирор жойда тўхташ учун оралиқ манзилларни қўшишингиз мумкин. Буюртма бериш вақтида муҳим тафсилотларни аниқлаштириш учун ҳайдовчига шарҳ ёзиш имконияти хам қулай.

Фойдали ва тезкор тариф.
Fasten – Fasten билан бошланади, бу ҳар кунги сафарлар учун фойдали, тез ва иш бўйича тариф.

Ҳаётдаги ҳар қандай вазият учун тарифлар:
Агар кўпроқ қулайлик зарур бўлса, Upperни танланг – бу тарифда ҳайдовчилар фақат юқори рейтингга эга, машиналар синфи эса юқори бўлади. Бутун шаҳар бўйлаб ёки аэропортга узоқ сафар кутилмоқдами? Кенг салонда кетишни истасангиз, Extra тарифини буюртма қилишни тавсия қиламиз. Max – бизнес класс автомобилларидаги сафарлар. Ҳайдовчилар расмий костюмда, ҳар доим эшикни очади, йўналиш ҳамда мусиқа бўйича таклифларингизни инобатга олади.

Тўловларнинг қулай усуллари:
Fasten иловасида нақд пулда ёки карта билан тўлов қилиш мумкин.

Севимли жойлар ва қулай йўналишлар:
Рўйхатдан керакли манзилни танлаш учун ""Танланганлар"" рукнига исталган манзилни киритиш мумкин – у ""Қаерга"" қаторига босилганда пайдо бўлади.

Это в 3 раза быстрее, чем по телефону! Между желанием доехать до нужного места и поиском автомобиля — пара секунд.

+ Экономьте свое время даже в мелочах

Адрес подачи определится автоматически. Вам остается указать, куда вы поедете. Используйте шаблоны с адресами и настройками, которыми чаще всего пользуетесь, чтобы заказать такси в пару кликов.

+ Создайте для себя максимальный комфорт

Добавьте к заказу дополнительные пожелания. Например, когда на улице +35 — выберите ""кондиционер"". Если вы не переносите запах табака — укажите ""Некурящий салон"", и к вам приедет некурящий водитель. 

+ Никаких проблем с оплатой

Оплачивайте поездки наличными или картой.

+ Забыли что-то добавить в заказ?

Отредактируйте его: поменяйте пожелания, остановки, адрес назначения и тариф, способ оплаты. 

+ Заказали такси, но не видите водителя?

Спросите в чате приложения, где он находится, или отправьте ваши координаты с помощью одной кнопки.

+ Нужно заказать такси родственнику или другу?

Используйте опцию ""Вызвать такси другому"" в разделе ""Пожелания"" и укажите его номер телефона. Когда такси подъедет, на указанный номер придет СМС, а вам — сообщение в приложении. Также вы можете поделиться информацией о своем заказе, просто скинув ссылку. Близкие люди будут точно знать где вы и с кем.

+ Планируете важную встречу, у вас рейс на самолет/поезд?

Выберите опцию ""Предварительный заказ"". Поиск автомобиля начнется незадолго до заказа поездки, и автомобиль приедет к назначенному времени. Также вы будете заранее знать стоимость поездки.

+ Сократите время ожидания такси

Спешите по делам? Увеличьте стоимость заказа, и водитель приедет на заказ быстрее. 

+ Понравилась поездка?

Поставьте оценку водителю, напишите отзыв, оставьте чаевые или выберите реакцию из готовых шаблонов.",2023-12-18T08:00:00Z,2025-11-21T05:24:45Z

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.
