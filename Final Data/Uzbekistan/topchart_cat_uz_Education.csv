uz,Uzbekistan,Education,6017,11,1514625154,Wisdom lug'ati: English-Uzbek,Husanboy Abdullayev,https://apps.apple.com/uz/app/wisdom-lugati-english-uzbek/id1514625154?uo=4,0.0,4.07493,694,Education,"Har qanday til o'rganuvchi uchun lug'at asosiy omil hisoblanadi va ko'pchilik ularni shunchaki so'zlarni tarjima qilib beruvchi oddiy vosita deb hisoblaydi. Lekin Wisdom lug'ati sizni odatdagi lug'at haqidagi tushunchalaringizni butunlay o'zgartirib yuboradi va ishonchimiz komilki bu lug'at tez orada sizning Ingliz tili o'rganish jarayoningizning ajralmas qismiga aylanadi.
Wisdom lug'ati siz kutgandan ko'ra ko'prog'ini taklif etadi:
120 000 dan ziyod so'z va iboralar
Wisdom lug'atida amaldagi mavjud so'zlardan tortib, muayyan sohaga oid 70 000 dan ziyod Inglizcha va 50 000 dan ortiq O'zbekcha so'z va iboralarni o'z ichiga olgan, O'zbekistondagi eng ko'p so'z va iboralarga ega bo'lgan yagona lug'at hisoblanadi.

Ishonchlilik
Ko'p mavjud lug'atlardagi so'z tarjimalari va tasniflari so'zning asl ma'nosiga unchalik ham to'g'ri kelavermaydi. Wisdom lug'atida esa besh yil davomida har bir so'z tarjimasi Oxford, MacMillan, Collins, Cambridge va Longman kabi ishonchli lug'atlardan foydalanib alohida yondashilgan holda, e'tibor bilan tarjima qilingan.

Yangicha O'zbekcha-Inglizcha!
Bu hususiyat bizning faxrimiz hisoblanadi. O'zbekcha so'zlarning Inglizcha ma'nolar hech qachon bunchalik aniqlik va osonlik bilan tarjima qilinmagan. E'tiborga loyiq tomoni shundaki, siz nafaqat so'zlarni (misol uchun non) balkim so'z birikmalarini (non yopmoq, non idish, non ushoq...), va hattoki muayyan ibora va jumlalarni (nonini yarimta qilmoq, og'zidan nonini olib qo'ymoq kabilarni) ham qidirishingiz mumkin. Bunday o'zgacha, ajoyib imkoniyatni sizga faqat Wisdom lug'atigina taqdim eta oladi.

Grammatika
So'zlarni lug'aviy ma'nosini bilish ularni to'g'ri ishlatish uchun yetarli emas. Muayyan bir so'zlarning o'ziga xos grammatik xususiyatlari, ishlatilish qonun qoidalarini mavjud va albatta Wisdom lug'ati bularni ham hisobga olgan holda so'zlarda Grammar bo'limini joriy etgan va bu bo'limda mazkur so'zga oid grammatik qonun qoidalar oddiy tushuntirishlar va o'rinli misolllar bilan batafsil tushintirilb o'tilgan.

So'z ketma-ketliklari (Collocations)
Hozirgi paytda o'quvchilarning eng katta muammolaridan biri bu Ingliz tilidagi to'g'ri so'z ketma-ketliklarini bilmasligidadir va oqibatda ular tuzmoqchi bo'lgan birikmalarini sun'iy ravishda tuzib noto'g'ri talqin qilishadi. Misol uchun o't qo'ymoq albatda put fire emas, va albatta o't o'chirmoq - switch off fire; o't boshlamoq - start fire; o't chiqmoq - go out fire bo'la olmaydi. Wisdom lug'atida albatta bu ham e'tiborga olingan va o'rganuvchilarni bunday xatolarga yo'l qo'ymasliklari uchun so'zlarda Collocations bo'limi tuzib chiqilgan. Bu bo'limda o'sha so'z atrofidagi jumlalarning to'g'ri ketma-ketligi misollar bilan guruhlarga ajratilgan holda berib o'tilgan.(Yuqoridagi so'z juftliklarning to'g'ri tasnifini bilish uchun esa fire so'zidagi Collocations bo'limiga qarang.)

So'zlarning lug'aviy farqlari
Boshqa tillar kabi Ingliz tilida ham ma'no jihatdan bir-biriga yaqin lekin biri boshqasining o'rnida ishlatila olmaydigan so'zlar talaygina. Misol uchun listen va hear; house yoki home; make yoki do; work yoki job kabi so'zlarni ko'pchilik farqlay olmasliklari mumkin. Shuni inobatga olgan holda Wisdom lug'ati o'rganuvchilarni qiynab yurgan shu va shu kabi so'zlar orasidagi tafovut va farqlarni sodda yondashuv va misollar bilan Thesaurus va Difference bo'limlarida batafsil tushuntirib beradi.

Qo'shimcha ma'lumotlar.
Wisdom lu'gati quyidagi har biri muhim va e'tiborga loyiq jihatlarni ham o'z ichiga oladi:
• Misollar
• Rasmlar
• Mashqlar
• Faol va nofaol so'zlar
• Sinonim va Antonimlar
• So'zlarning qaysi shevada ishlatilishi [BrE, AmE, CanE...]
• Qaysi predlog va so'z turkumlari bilan kelishi [~ in/with sth] [~ adv/adj]
• Qaysi sohaga oidligi [biology, math...]
• Sanaladigan yoki sanalmasligi [C, U]
• Rasmiy yoki norasmiyligi [formal] [informal]
• Akademik yoki noakademik so'z ekanligi [AW]
• So'zlarning qanday talaffuz qilinishi
• So'z metaforasi (Metaphor)
• So'zga oid tekst (Culture)",2020-07-13T07:00:00Z,2025-07-22T01:58:46Z
