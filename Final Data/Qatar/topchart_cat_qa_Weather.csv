Zoom Earth is an interactive weather map of the world and a real-time tracker of storms and hurricanes.

Explore the current weather and see forecasts for your location through interactive weather maps of rain, wind, temperature, pressure, and more.

With Zoom Earth, you can track the development of storms, hurricanes, and severe weather, monitor wildfires and smoke, and stay aware of the latest conditions by viewing satellite imagery updated in near real‑time.



SATELLITE IMAGERY

Zoom Earth shows weather maps with near real-time satellite imagery. Images are updated every 10 minutes, with a delay between 20 and 40 minutes.

Live satellite images are updated every 10 minutes from NOAA GOES and JMA Himawari geostationary satellites. EUMETSAT Meteosat images are updated every 15 minutes.

HD satellite images are updated twice a day from NASA polar-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra.



RAIN RADAR & NOWCAST

Stay ahead of the storm with our weather radar map, which shows rain and snow detected by ground-based Doppler radar in real-time, and provides an instant short-term weather forecast with radar nowcasting.



WEATHER FORECAST MAPS

Explore beautiful, interactive visualisations of the weather with our stunning global forecast maps. Our maps are continually updated with the latest weather forecast model data from DWD ICON and NOAA/NCEP/NWS GFS. Weather forecast maps include:

Precipitation Forecast - Rain, snow, and cloud cover, all in one map.

Wind Speed Forecast - Average speed and direction of surface winds.

Wind Gusts Forecast - Maximum speed of sudden bursts of wind.

Temperature Forecast - Air temperatures at 2 meters (6 feet) above the ground.

""Feels Like"" Temperature Forecast - Perceived temperatures, also known as apparent temperature or heat index.

Relative Humidity Forecast - How air moisture compares to temperature.

Dew Point Forecast - How dry or humid the air feels, and the point at which condensation occurs.

Atmospheric Pressure Forecast - The average atmospheric pressure at sea level. Low-pressure areas often bring cloudy and windy weather. High-pressure areas are associated with clear skies and lighter winds.



HURRICANE TRACKING

Follow hurricanes from development to category 5 in real-time with our best-in-class tropical tracking system. Information is clear and easy to understand. Our hurricane tracking weather maps are updated using the very latest data from NHC, JTWC, NRL, and IBTrACS.



WILDFIRE TRACKING

Monitor wildfires with our active fires and heat spots overlay, which shows points of very high temperature detected by satellite. Detections are updated daily with data from NASA FIRMS. Use in conjunction with our GeoColor satellite imagery to see the movement of wildfire smoke and monitor fire weather in near real-time.



CUSTOMISATION

Adjust temperature units, wind units, time zone, animation styles, and many more features with our comprehensive settings.

AuroraMe turns live space-weather and local sky conditions into a clear aurora forecast for tonight, with real-time alerts, KP index, NOAA/Ovation data, and a visibility map near you.

Why AuroraMe
- Built for ""northern lights tonight"" decisions — see None / Possible / Likely / Visible at a glance.
- Actionable insights, not raw charts.
- Privacy-first by design.

What You Get
- Now: concise status with the factors that drive it.
- Best Time Tonight: the exact hour with the highest chance to see the northern lights.
- Live Map: Ovation oval, KP index, cloud cover, darkness, and moon phase combined into one aurora visibility map.
- Smart Alerts: notifications when visibility spikes near you; thresholds, cooldowns, and Quiet Hours prevent night spam.
- 3-Day & 27-Day Forecasts: short windows for chasing plus monthly trends for planning.
- Tracker Tools: probability, storm activity, and recent changes as conditions evolve.

How It Works
- Blends NOAA SWPC (Ovation, Kp), GFZ geomagnetic data, and local weather (Open-Meteo, MET Norway).
- Models cloud cover, darkness, lunar light, and magnetic latitude to estimate visibility and trigger alerts at the right moment.

Locations & Privacy
- Save places worldwide or tap Use Current Location once.
- Change or remove locations anytime.
- Location is accessed only on demand — no background tracking.

Plans
- Free: 1 location, up to 3 alerts/day, 20-minute updates, “Tonight” view up to 12 hours.
- Premium: up to 10 locations, real-time updates, 72-hour forecast, advanced smart alerts, full map layers.
- Manage subscriptions in-app; Restore Purchases available on the paywall.

Example
- Add Fairbanks or Tromsø and enable ""Likely Visible"" alerts with Quiet Hours 02:00–08:00 — you'll get notified when KP, darkness, and low clouds line up so you don’t miss the show.

Notes
- Aurora visibility depends on many natural factors and can’t be guaranteed.
- Data sources may have latency; we surface that when relevant.

This aurora notification app shows notifications when it may be possible to see the northern lights (aurora borealis / australis)!

It provides configurable thresholds for local aurora probability, Kp-index (Hp30), solar wind parameters (Bz/Bt) and Kp-level forecast for the evening.

It also allows you to be alerted when other app users nearby have seen the aurora light display. For the alert feature to work, other app users register aurora reports when they are successful hunting and get to see the aurora light display. This has proven to be quite successful.

Many of the app users also upload pictures of northern lights when they see them, and in this app you can see these pictures. You can also see dots on a 3d-globe animation showing where people have just observed the light show. There are users in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand who regularly report their observations and upload pictures.

Although the chances are greater if you live in Alaska, northern Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the southern tip of New Zealand etc, there are also regular opportunities in places like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, Montana, Michigan, Chicago, New York, Scotland, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Baltics etc.

The premium version which can be bought within the app itself offers some more technical information and graphs of Kp-index predictions, cloud cover and solar wind parameters - and some hidden features.

The app has an associated X account (@aurora_notifier - https://x.com/aurora_notifier) and an Instagram account (@auroranotifierapp - https://www.instagram.com/auroranotifierapp). Consider following those.",2025-04-09T07:00:00Z,2025-04-27T09:03:39Z

Dedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).
