Number 1 in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and elsewhere! ***

This is the simplest-to-use contraction timer. The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.
If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us.",2014-07-20T03:35:07Z,2025-06-22T09:11:31Z
