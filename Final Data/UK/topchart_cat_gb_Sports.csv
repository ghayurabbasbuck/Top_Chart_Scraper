Paddy Power offers more bet builder markets than any other bookmaker. And, as if that weren’t enough good news, Paddy’s offering Bet Builder Insurance too – meaning if one leg of your 4+ leg Bet Builder ACCA lets you down, you get money back as a free bet up to £/€10!

Bet with Paddy! Download the Paddy Power Sports Betting App today to join our online sports betting community.

• Super Sub
We’ve all been there. Watching the match, the centre forwards are in blistering goalscoring form and you’ve chucked them in a bet – then they dislocate an eyelash in the first few minutes and hobble off. That’s the end of that. Not anymore. If your player selection is hauled off, your bet will switch over to whoever replaces them, and thus the Super Sub was born!

• Multi Match Bet Builder
Combine your Bet Builder across multiple matches!

• Popular Bet Builder
Not sure who to back in your bet builder? Follow the crowd with Paddy’s new Most Popular Bet Builders feature. This feature lets you see what bet builders other people are backing in real-time.

• Bet Builder Markets
We've added fouls and shots on target markets to improve your bet builder options.

• Bet Builder Tracker
New and improved features to track your bet builder in play.

• ACCA Stats
Acca stats is the next-level analysis of how you’ve been doing in your multiples. Browse the bets that have been your biggest achievements. See which markets you’ve had the most success with and which ones are not your strong suit so that you know which bets to go for the next time you build a bet builder!

• Player Stats 
Our new Player Stats feature gives you access to relevant player data such as goals, shots and cards for every game, to give you more information for your bet

• Live streaming
We live stream 100,000 events every year across sports such as Football, Horse Racing, Tennis, Snooker, Greyhound Racing & and much more
