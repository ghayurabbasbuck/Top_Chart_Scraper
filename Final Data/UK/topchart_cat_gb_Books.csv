It’s now easier to read the Quran on the go, memorize it and listen to your favorite reciters.

This is just the beginning for Quran for iOS. We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com

As the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter.
