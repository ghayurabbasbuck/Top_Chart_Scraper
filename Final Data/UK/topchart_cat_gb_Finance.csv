Already a customer? Nice one! You can get started by using your usual log on details (Don't already have log on details? Visit santander.co.uk to register – it's quick & easy) 

Now, we're pretty proud of our App and we've got good reason to be - it's award winning* Not only that, but it's secure, fast and you can use it anywhere, anytime, which is great if you're bit of a night owl. 

Here's the basic lowdown on what you can do: 

•            check your balance and statements. We know, it's a pretty scary task to do after a big night out  

•            not sure if you've already paid for something? Search transactions will let you find out instantly 

•            transfer money between your Santander accounts. Perfect if you want to put some spare cash away for a rainy day, or save for that new car  

•            send money to other people. Which is great if you're splitting the bill  

•            check your Direct Debits and standing orders 

•            control your card, 'freeze' it in those moments where you're sure your cards somewhere in the house, just not sure where 

•            pay in cheques, up to £5k a day 

•            we've got some handy features like My Money Manager and My Home Manager. Let’s just say it'll make things a lot more 'insightful' 

•            thanks to biometrics, payment authorisation and discreet mode you can rest easy knowing you're banking securely.
