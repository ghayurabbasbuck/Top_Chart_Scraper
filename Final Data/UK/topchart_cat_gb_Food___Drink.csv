How does First Table work?
Participating restaurants list their first tables for breakfast, lunch or dinner on First Table – showing seven days of availability on our platform. 

Diners are then rewarded with 50% off the food bill for dining at an off-peak time. 

To secure 50% off the food bill, select your city and search through the available restaurants near you. Then select your date and time and book a First Table (booking fee applies) for two, three or four people. 

What’s in it for the restaurant?
Restaurants choose to join at their own discretion, to help fill empty tables and to create a buzz early into their service. That means that while you’re tucking into a half-price brunch or boujee-on-a-budget dinner, you’re also doing them a favour.

Discover new restaurants!
Browse nearby restaurants to discover a hidden gem in your own backyard or lock in top-rated restaurants you’ve always wanted to try. Craving a particular meal? Restaurants are also searchable by restaurant name or cuisine.

What’s the catch?
There isn’t one - that’s the best part! First Table is a win-win for restaurants and diners alike. Restaurants get early customers through the door and diners get rewarded for dining at times that restaurants need them most.

By dining on First Table, you'll not only have a great excuse to connect with mates, dates and fellow foodies, but you'll also be supporting hospitality venues by dining at the times that they need you the most.

Have friends you’d love to dine with? You can even earn credit by sharing First Table with other foodies! Just grab your promo code from your profile, and you’ll both get your next restaurant booking fee half price.",2022-05-12T07:00:00Z,2025-11-11T19:57:29Z
