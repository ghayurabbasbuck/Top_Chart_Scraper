It works by matching your face to your photo ID.

You can also use this app to save a digital version of your HM Armed Forces Veteran Card to your phone. 

In future you'll be able to save other digital documents, such as your driving licence. This is not available yet.

Before you start

You need to get this app if you’re:
• using a service on the GOV.UK website that asks you to prove your identity with GOV.UK One Login
• saving your digital Veteran Card to your phone

You’ll be guided to this app when it is time to use it.

What you need

You can use any of the following types of photo ID to prove your identity:
• UK passport
• non-UK passport with a biometric chip
• UK photocard driving licence
• UK biometric residence permit (BRP)
• UK biometric residence card (BRC)
• UK Frontier Worker permit (FWP)

You can use an expired BRP, BRC or FWP up to 18 months after its expiry date.

You need to have your original photo ID with you. You cannot use a photocopy or digital copy.

You will also need:
• a well-lit area where you can take a good quality photograph
• an iPhone 8 or newer
• iOS 16.7 or higher

How it works

You'll need to sign in to the app with your GOV.UK  One Login details. This links the app to the GOV.UK website so you can continue proving your identity.

If your photo ID is a passport, BRP, BRC or FWP you will:
• take a photo of your photo ID
• scan the biometric chip in your photo ID using your phone
• scan your face using your phone

If your photo ID is a driving licence you will:
• take a photo of your driving licence
• scan your face using your phone

What happens next

Once your information has been submitted in the app, you'll need to go back to the GOV.UK website, so you can finish proving your identity and access the service you were trying to use.
 
Privacy and security

The personal information you provide to prove your identity will not be saved either on the app or on your phone. We collect your data securely and delete it when it is no longer needed.
Digital documents you add to the app will be saved on your phone so you can access them whenever you need.",2025-06-09T07:00:00Z,2025-11-11T08:15:37Z

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.",2015-05-30T09:25:44Z,2025-11-13T23:54:23Z
