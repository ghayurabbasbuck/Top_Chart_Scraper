It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.

* Scientific Research *

The popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.

You can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.

* Full Version *

This is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:

- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.
- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.
- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.
- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.

* How to Use *

To generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:

- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).
- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).
- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).

The application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen.",2013-07-25T00:43:43Z,2021-05-12T01:09:43Z

If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.

Whether as a Paramedic on scene or as a clinician in hospital, this app can assist in running structured and effective adult cardiac arrest scenarios. Developed by clinicians working in large inner city teaching hospitals, this app takes into consideration the most recent Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2021.
 
It serves as an aide-memoire for basic tasks that can easily be overlooked in stressful scenarios. iArrest also incorporates a number of timers to assist with rhythm analysis, adrenaline timings and arrest documentation. It will remind the user via audible and visual cues about necessary  interventions even if a clinician’s phone is muted. iArrest has been programmed to prevent phones from going into sleep mode, in order to ensure continuous use throughout the arrest.
 
iArrest will record the exact time an important event or an intervention has occurred and present the user with a detailed log of events. These logs can be copied to the clipboard and used for documentation and record keeping.


iArrest is currently undergoing extensive testing in simulated and real world scenarios. 

We are continuously improving and expanding on iArrest’s functionality.
