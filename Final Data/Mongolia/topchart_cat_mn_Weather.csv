Here’s a quick Autumn 2025 Outlook from our resident Meteorologist and check out our app features below to make the most of this season:

“This autumn is looking to be unusually warm for the UK, while rainfall should be more variable throughout the season. We’re expecting near normal rainfall for the season, but ex-tropical cyclones can bring intense periods of rain at this time of the year. There’s also potential for above average wind in the UK this autumn, due to the increased risk of ex-tropical cyclones or sub-tropical cyclones reaching Europe. As always, check the local weather forecasts and warnings for your area.”


FREE WEATHER APP FEATURES  

◆ Weather Observations: Current conditions for your local area including temperature, ‘feels like’ temperature, wind gusts, rain, humidity, dew point, and pressure. 

◆ Radar Map: Visually track where rain and snow are moving in your area with the real-time radar map. You can turn on/off other free layers including wind. 

◆ Hourly Graphs: Before you head out the door, swipe through the hourly graphs for temperature, chance of rain, rainfall amount, wind, humidity, and more. On top of knowing when it will rain and how much rain could fall, keep an eye out for the snow icon – this means the precipitation is likely to fall as snow. 

◆ Daily & Hourly Weather Forecasts: Swipe through the forecast scroller at the top of your Home tab to see hourly breakdowns of temperature, rain, and wind. Or scroll down for handy Daily Forecasts that also show these along with UV index, sunrise and sunset times.

What people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:

- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.
by jefffafa123

- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!
by AndyLPhoto

- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!
by AwesomeV01

- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.
