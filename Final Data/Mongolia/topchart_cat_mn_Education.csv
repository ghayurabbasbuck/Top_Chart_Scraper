Initiated by the President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj and supported by the Office of the President, in 2016 the researchers of the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences organized the “Great Dictionary of the Mongolian Language” with more than 60,000 headwords and 80,000 related words from the Mongolian language vocabulary. This time, we are updating the mobile version of the dictionary with the support of the Ministry of Culture.
From this dictionary, you can see the explanations of the words you are interested in, examples of literary and local dialects, national script, and listen to the pronunciation online. It is now possible to add spelling, spelling of headwords, and differences in the meaning of the same word.

About the English test and certificate

The EnglishScore test is delivered on a mobile phone, so it requires different security measures and rules. 

We use security features such as face monitoring technology through your smartphone’s selfie camera. You must be alone in a quiet place with your whole face clearly in the camera during the test.

These rules help give you and organisations confidence that your results are accurate and reliable.

To take the test and purchase a certificate, you will need to turn on your test security.

Once the test is complete, EnglishScore awards you with an internationally recognised CEFR level from A2 to C1 and a more detailed score between 0 and 599 aligned to the CEFR framework. This is a recognised global standard for describing language levels. You can use your CEFR score to compare results with tests such as IELTS, TOEIC and TOEFL.

The British Council EnglishScore Professional Certificate is recognised by leading employers and education institutions around the world.

You can use a Professional Certificate to help advance your career, including applying for a job or to enhance your CV.

EnglishScore is also available for businesses, universities and colleges that are looking to conduct English tests at scale. Learn more here:https://www.englishscore.com/for-business/
