Through the ‘Call 995’ button in the app, users can also send their geolocation to SCDF’s 995 Operations Centre, enabling SCDF to dispatch the emergency resources to the scene sooner.

myResponder works by notifying members of the public – also known as Community First Responders (CFRs) – of nearby cardiac arrest and fire cases. myResponder will also highlight nearby AEDs that may be available to responders, and provide guided advisories in the mitigation of minor fires. CFRs can then proceed to the stated location and assist by performing CPR or applying an AED to revive the patient, mitigating minor fires using available extinguishing means, or providing further information to SCDF’s 995 Operations Centre.

If you are 15 years and above and wish to volunteer, be sure to get your SingPass ID and password ready. If you are under 18 years old, please seek parental consent for your participation. Your handphone number is also required for SCDF to get in touch with you during an emergency. 

Your response is entirely voluntary, and we only encourage you to respond when you are available and to do so within safe and reasonable means.
