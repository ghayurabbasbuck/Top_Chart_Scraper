What exactly is Cashback? Where does the money come from?

If you love shopping online, you’re probably always looking for a good deal. Cashback, coupon codes and browser extensions all help you save money, and you've come to the right place!

So, what is Cashback? When you click through ShopBack to our partners, we give you a portion of your spending back. Stores pay us commissions for sending our members to their platforms, and we share that with you in the form of Cashback. It's a win-win, and a great way to earn money while shopping online! 

The best part about getting Cashback is, of course, cashing out. Get yourself some extra money to shop more! 

How do you get Cashback?
Sign up for your free ShopBack account and browse on our app, website or browser extension to find what you love.
Click through ShopBack to be redirected to the store’s site. Shop, apply the coupon code that you’ve found on our site, and pay as you normally would. 
Cashback will be tracked in your ShopBack account and ready to be withdrawn once the store and ShopBack have verified your purchase.
