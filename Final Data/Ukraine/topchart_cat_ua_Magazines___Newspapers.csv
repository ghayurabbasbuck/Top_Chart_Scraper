Ни на каком другом языке вы не найдете столько литературных вопросов, вопросов с юмором, вопросов с контекстом происходящего в мире сегодня. И всё это в обычных кроссвордах, хотя, казалось бы, какая ерунда. Русский народ – народ слова. И любит своё слово, и держит своё слово, и относится к слову как к самому дорогому.

Сканворды в приложении разнообразные - попроще и посложнее, с фотографиями, с классическими вопросами или ассоциативными: «одним словом» либо «раз слово, два слово», как подсказки старца Фура. В любом журнале есть один англо-русский сканворд и один «дыркавнос», надеюсь, вы поймёте, почему его так назвали. На каждой странице вас встречает персонаж нашей весёлой семейки. Присоединяйтесь!

Все сканворды для читателя бесплатны. Это годовая коллекция: 52-53 номера по 20 сканвордов в каждом. Полный годовой арсенал сканвордов «съест» на телефоне около 50 Мбайт - картинки маленькие, текст - это текст. Мы ценим место на вашем телефоне.

Интернет для разгадывания не нужен. При условии, что сами сканворды уже на вашем телефоне. Каждую пятницу выходит новый номер журнала. Если вы оставили активной опцию «уведомление», то один раз в неделю в пятницу в 12-00 по местному времени придёт напоминание о новом номере. При входе в приложение загрузка нового журнала происходит автоматически и при её успешном завершении более не повторяется. Кроме того, можно загрузить или удалить на телефон поштучно любой из журналов, либо через «Настройки» скачать все журналы в один клик.

Основные возможности, в том числе доступ ко всем сканвордам, в приложении для читателя бесплатны. Банкет оплачивает рекламодатель. Ему разрешено иметь один узкий баннер на каждой странице + один показ межстраничной рекламы перед открытием сканворда. Наш рекламодатель не прерывает процесс разгадывания. Также рекламодатель щедро награждает читателя бесплатными подсказками за просмотр своих роликов. 

Любой читатель вправе, но не обязан, «перебить» рекламодателя, и: а) отключить рекламу навсегда, б) оформить подписку, которая на срок подписки отключает рекламу и даёт неограниченные подсказки, в) набрать подсказок на развес. Все эти возможности представлены на витрине в «Магазине».

Подписка - стандартный механизм Apple. 
1) Подписка возможна на три срока - неделя, месяц или год.
2) Подписка автоматически продлеваемая. Средства за возобновление подписки будут взиматься в течение 24 часов до конца текущего периода. 
3) Подписка подключается или отключается стандартно через iTunes, ссылка управления внизу. При желании отказаться от возобновления подписки пользователю необходимо это сделать не позднее, чем за 24 часа до конца текущего периода. При этом оплаченный период подписки отработает до конца.
