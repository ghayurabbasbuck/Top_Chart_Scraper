Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.
- The subscription automatically renews. The renewal cost will be charged to your account 24 hours before the end of the current subscription, if auto-renewal has not been turned off.
- You can easily manage subscriptions in your Apple account settings – for example, turn off automatic subscription renewal right after purchase.

FROM THE APP'S CREATOR 

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!


Growing up is not easy! But we support parents and children every day on this exciting journey.

Don’t just listen — design your sleep environment. Combine sounds like rain, ocean waves, or birdsong with white noise and meditation music to build your personal soundscape. Every sound helps you find calm, focus, and rest.

Track & Record Your Nights

Sleepway is more than a sleep tracker. It’s also a powerful recorder that captures nighttime sounds like snoring, talking, or yawning. Together, the sleep tracker and recorder reveal how you sleep, while meditation and white noise help you improve it.

Discover Insights That Matter

With Sleepway’s sleep tracker, see how long you slept, view your patterns, and check what the recorder picked up during the night. Use these insights along with calming sounds, meditation, and white noise to build healthier sleep habits.

Simple, Sound-Centered Design

Sleepway keeps everything easy. Browse the sound library, enjoy meditation sessions, mix soothing sounds with white noise, and access your sleep tracker & recorder — all in a clean and intuitive interface.

Sleep Notes & Sleep Factors: Keep a mini journal before bed and log factors that may affect your sleep — like coffee, alcohol, stress, or light exposure. Combine your notes with Sleepway’s sleep tracker and recorder to see how these factors impact your nights.

Wake-Up Mood Log & Graphs: Track how you feel each morning. Record your wake-up mood and follow your patterns over time with simple, easy-to-read graphs. Pair this with meditation and calming sounds to improve both sleep and mornings.

Breathwork & Heart Rate Tracking: Sleepway links breathwork directly to your heart rate tracker. If your heart rate is elevated, the app guides you through calming breathing exercises. With sound therapy, meditation, and white noise, you’ll lower stress and prepare for deeper sleep.
