Information about the auto-renewable nature of the subscription

A subscription is not essential to get access to the full learning materials. You can also gain access by uploading content that adds value to the community. Otherwise, content can be unlocked through in-app-purchases. However, subscriptions are useful for users who want full access without any further action required. The subscribed user does not have to pay attention to our digital currency. Therefore, full access to the app is Lengo Pro.

Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. Your iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your iTunes Account Settings.
