We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.

inDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers.
 
But now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.

The main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. 

What We Offer

CITY RIDES
Affordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.

INTERCITY RIDES
A safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. 

COURIER SERVICES
This door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.

FREIGHT SERVICES
Book a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.

Why choose inDrive
QUICK AND EASY
It's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points ""A"" and ""B"" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.

OFFER YOUR FARE
inDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.

CHOOSE YOUR DRIVER
inDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.

STAY SAFE
See the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the ""Share Your Ride"" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.

ADD TRAVEL OPTIONS
Do you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like ""traveling with my pet,"" “I have luggage,"" etc.

SIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY
If you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.
Best of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!

We can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!",2013-12-19T22:19:46Z,2025-11-20T08:07:32Z

Fill your life with movement. Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!

Choose the right service class for you
Reach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!

Ride safely
Safety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.

Smart destinations
Yango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!

Multiple destinations, one route
Yango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. 

Request rides for close ones
Show you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.

Refer friends and get discounts
Invite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.

Meet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages

We've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. 

An international service
Yango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.

Yango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.
The size and duration of the discount for the first rides requested via the Yango app vary depending on the country and city. Open the app for specific details.

Для езды на наших электробайках не нужны водительские права и документы. На карте в приложении отмечены все наши электробайки, доступные для аренды. Они ярко-зелёные, других таких нет, ты не ошибёшься. 


АРЕНДОВАТЬ ЛЕГКО
Найди бибибайк на карте, отсканируй QR-код на руле через приложение и привяжи карту. Нажми «Начать поездку» и катайся. Все просто!

НАМ ЕСТЬ, ЧТО РАССКАЗАТЬ
+ Максимальная скорость: 25 км/ч
+ Запас хода: до 80 км 
+ Время работы на одном заряде: до 4 часов
+ Корзина на 5 кг: поместится всё, что нужно
+ Можно арендовать несколько бибибайков и кататься семьей
+ Комфортнее других видов кикшеринга
+ Подходит для любых целей: прогулки, поездки по делам и за покупками, или активный отдых

НОВЫЙ ФОРМАТ ГОРОДСКОГО ШЕРИНГА
bb.bike это не просто ещё один сервис аренды транспорта. Мы предлагаем новый формат шеринга — электробайки, которые эргономичнее, удобнее и безопаснее самокатов.

Бибибайки устойчивы и комфортны для поездок. Большие колёса и удобное сиденье сделают твоё передвижение мягким даже если дорожное покрытие далеко от идеала. Короче, никакой тряски:)

БРОНИРУЙ БИБИБАЙК ЗАРАНЕЕ
Забронируй бибибайк в приложении, и он будет ждать тебя 10 минут бесплатно. Никто другой на нем не уедет.

РАЗНЫЕ ТАРИФЫ
«Поминутный» тариф выгоден для небольших поездок и не надо заморачиваться. А если хочешь кататься долго, бери на несколько часов или сразу на сутки, тем более в них бесплатная активация.

ВЫГОДНЫЕ ПОЕЗДКИ С БОНУСАМИ
Покупай пакеты бонусов и катайся ещё выгоднее. 1 бонус = 1 рублю. Чем больше сумма пополнения, тем больше бонусов!

СТРАХОВКА ДЛЯ БЕЗОПАСНЫХ ПОЕЗДОК
Во время поездки можно включить страхование через приложение. Оно защитит тебя от непредвиденных ситуаций, а любое происшествие решается быстро и удобно.

БЕРИ С СОБОЙ
Каждый бибибайк оснащён корзинкой на 5 кг.  Удобно возить продукты с рынка, спортивную сумку по пути в спортзал или другие вещи. Только не надо класть туда своего четвероногого друга, это не безопасно. Теперь мелкие дела по городу стали проще и комфортнее!
ПРАВИЛА АРЕНДЫ
Правила аренды для разных городов могут отличаться, поэтому рекомендуем ознакомиться с ними перед поездкой.
В целом, принцип шеринга похож на приложения Whoosh, MTS Urent, Yandex Go, Все самокаты, Jet, Sun Rent, Lite и другие: находишь байк на карте, сканируешь QR-код, выбираешь тариф и начинаешь поездку.

ВАЖНО ЗНАТЬ
Бибибайк предназначен для одного человека. На бибибайке вдвоём кататься нельзя (да и неудобно). Но мы предусмотрели классную опцию: можно арендовать сразу несколько бибибайков с одного аккаунта и гонять компанией!


А еще больше информации, подробные описания тарифов, а также инструкции можно найти на нашем сайте: https://bb.bike/",2025-08-27T07:00:00Z,2025-11-10T17:22:22Z

If you choose to upgrade to a Silver or Gold subscription, a payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings in the iTunes Store. Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.
