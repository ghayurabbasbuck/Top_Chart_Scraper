If you try many weight loss methods that don't work, or encounter a platform period, you might as well try this global popular weight loss method.

What is light fasting?

Light fasting, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Light fasting does not mean dieting, but a dietary pattern that circulates between fasting and eating. It does not specify the food you should or cannot eat, but the time you should eat.

What is the principle of light fasting?

Its main principle is that during intermittent fasting, the body will run out of stored sugar and then start burning fat. A small sample study shows that after 8 weeks of light fasting diet, the average weight decreased by 5.6kg, the average waist circumference decreased by 4.0cm, and the blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride also decreased.

Is light fasting healthy?

Light fasting is best known for weight loss and detoxification. Studies have shown that light fasting can change hormone content and promote fat decomposition in the body as energy.
