Based on a “let the game be the teacher” philosophy, we offer you 360 age-appropriate short videos designed to engage, enthuse and inspire children of all abilities. The app is your first step towards fostering children’s holistic development by introducing them to the “beautiful game”.

The FIFA Football for Schools experience is all about games, not drills!

Our playing philosophy for children in schools is to encourage the use of simple game formats in every lesson. These games can include certain types of repetition in order to improve technical and tactical development, but more importantly, they should provide children with the opportunity for social interaction within a fun and friendly environment, always building in time for free play and exploration.

Highlights:
•	360 short videos designed for age-specific child development stages: 4-7 years, 8-11 years and 12-14 years.
•	40 physical education sessions divided into fun warm-up games, skill development games and a final game incorporating variations of football.
•	Each video lasts 60-90 seconds, highlighting the organisation of players and what you will need (e.g. balls and other material).
•	The app includes illustrations to show how exercises can be adapted to meet your individual school/class needs, based on your pitch size, equipment and the number of children in your class.
•	Each of our games focuses on simple class organisation and the involvement, inclusion and engagement of all children, with opportunities for both basic skill execution and challenging progressions.
•	Each teacher can select an individual session/lesson or a programme of sessions in line with football’s place in the school’s curriculum.

Who is it for? 
•	You DO NOT HAVE TO BE A QUALIFIED FOOTBALL COACH to benefit from our app. It can be used by any physical education teacher or adult in a similar role.
•	The idea is that, after copying the sessions and exercises initially, teachers will be inspired to adapt them and then create their own as they become more familiar with the organisation and set-up of games. 
•	It is designed to equip teachers with an online toolkit of ready-made solutions – a plug and play programme that provides hours and weeks of age-appropriate football activities for physical education lessons within the school curriculum.

App features:
•	Easy to use and navigate.
•	Select your lessons based on your unique teaching circumstances.
•	Learn teaching and football techniques directly from FIFA experts.
•	Select from up to 40 lessons for your class.
•	Save your favourite lessons to build your own curriculum.
We are committed to:
•	developing the child first and the football player second;
•	providing fun games that foster social interaction and cater for individual challenges;
•	promoting the values of football as a school for life.
