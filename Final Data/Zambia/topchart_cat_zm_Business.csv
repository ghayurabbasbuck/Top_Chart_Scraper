Easily connect to participants on mobile devices, desktops, and in other rooms across a variety of locations.

The Zoom Rooms app on iPad has five modes to choose from: Zoom Rooms Controller, Zoom Rooms for Touch, scheduling display, workspace desk, and reservation only room.

“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“
