The 2018 AO/OTA Fracture and Dislocation Classification is a streamlined, concise, and clinically relevant tool for coding fractures and dislocations.

It is the standard classification used by trauma surgeons and physicians dealing with skeletal trauma worldwide. The Classification was revised in 2018 and the new app was updated to reflect these changes.

The app provides beginners and experts with a reference tool to: 
• Learn how to apply the classification system
• Utilize common terminology when classifying fractures
• Apply the principles of fracture classification
• Provide standard codes for research purposes

The content and design of the app makes the Classification simpler to use. The AO/OTA Classification app makes injury descriptions more reliable, thus improving research and fracture outcomes assessments.

Features:
• Information regarding radiological investigations used for classifying a specific fracture 
• Common pitfalls with imaging are addressed
• All new fracture illustrations 
• High-quality, enlargeable x-rays are included
• Fracture codes can be added to ""Favorites"" for personalized reference

The second reversion of ""AO/OTA's Fracture and Dislocation Compendium"" from 2018 led to some major changes in the AO classification system using ""qualifications"" and ""modifiers"". With these sub-classifications the system became - beside being very precise in fracture classification - very complex and less handy for the daily business.

As trauma surgeons we need to classify a lot of fractures every day. So I created this application to easily browse through the body regions and refine the fracture code step by step by just clicking on the fractured body part and selecting the type of fracture - shown as picture and descriptive text. In the end of this process you can precise your classification even more by selecting global modifiers. Furthermore a list of fracture specific ""qualifications"" (if there are some for the chosen fracture) is presented to you. That way you can easily classify and specify complex fractures.

FRACTURES:
The current version supports a fracture classification system for the following body parts in adults:
  - Humerus
  - Scapula
  - Clavicula
  - Thorax (Sternum and Ribs)

  - Spine
  - Pelvis

DISLOCATIONS:
