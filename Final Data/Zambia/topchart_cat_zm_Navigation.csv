With our GPS-powered app, you can see your precise location and plan routes straight to your destination in Dubai, Baku, and many other cities. The app shows you directions that avoid traffic, up-to-date bus schedules, and knows all those fast, easy walking routes that take you around obstacles. The interface and voice navigation prompts support several languages, including English and Arabic.

With Yango Maps, you get a stress-free driving experience with real-time updates on the road and clear instructions on how to navigate complex intersections. In Dubai, the map displays the roads in high detail complete with all their lane markings, multi-level interchanges, tunnels, traffic lights, parking spots, and more. You'll get warnings about upcoming traffic, road closures, and speed limits ahead of time so you'll definitely get there on schedule. 

The app also directs you straight to convenient parking and drop-off locations near your destination so that nothing stands between you and the places you need to go. To add to that, the navigator works even without an internet connection — simply download a map of the city to search for organizations and get driving directions even offline.

If you're not in the driving seat, you can book a ride through the built-in Yango ride-hailing service, find out when your bus is scheduled, and get a streamlined walking route so you can get to the desired location with ease.

In another step toward an enhanced navigation experience, Yango Maps displays iconic Dubai landmarks in full-color 3D, including Burj Khalifa, Dubai Frame, the Museum of The Future, and the Jumeirah Mosque. Switching to dark mode triggers lifelike lighting effects on the 3D models right on the map, realistically replicating the city’s evening ambience.

Yango Maps is also available in CarPlay, so you can see your route laid out in front of you as you drive. This currently works in the UAE and Azerbaijan, and we'll add support for more locations in upcoming updates.

Download Yango Maps — and feel truly free to explore.
