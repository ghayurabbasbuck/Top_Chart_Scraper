Our creators march to the beat of their own drum, as do we, disrupting our opps with a 95-5 subscription split, our creator incentive program, and the freedom to multistream.


That’s why the likes of xQc, Amouranth, and MaxHolloway all pick Kick.


For viewers, it’s the fear of missing out that compels them to tune in, the chance to be part of internet culture, all in real-time and ad-free.


but lets be real, no one reads these, so if youve made it this far, at least give the app 5 stars. it will good for my performance review. thanks :)
