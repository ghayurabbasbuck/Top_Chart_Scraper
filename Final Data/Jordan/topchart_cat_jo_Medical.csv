You can check your glucose by scanning your sensor with your phone. Now FreeStyle Libre 2 system sensor users can get automatic glucose readings in the FreeStyle LibreLink app, updated every minute, and also receive alarms when your glucose is low or high. [1][2]

You can use the FreeStyle LibreLink app to:

* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow and glucose history
* Receive low or high glucose alarms with FreeStyle Libre 2 system sensors [2]
* Add notes to track your food, insulin use and exercise
* See reports, such as Time in Range and Daily Patterns
* Share your data with your doctor and family, with your permission [3]

SMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY
Compatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.

USING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR
Alarms can only be issued on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader or your phone (not both). To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.

Remember that the app and reader do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your sensor every eight hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data. You can upload and view data from all of your devices on LibreView.com.

APP INFORMATION
FreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a sensor. For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the app. If you require a printed User’s Manual, contact Abbott Diabetes Care Customer Support.

Consult a healthcare professional to confirm if this product is right for you or if you have questions about how to use this product to make treatment decisions.

Learn more at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.

[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system, as the app does not provide one.  

[2] Alarms that you receive do not include your glucose reading, so you must scan your sensor to check your glucose.

[3] Use of FreeStyle LibreLink and LibreLinkUp requires registration with LibreView.
