Use the trip planner to quickly compare trips, including bus, ferry, bike, metro or rail, and subway options. Get alerted about service disruptions and delays for your favorite lines, and save frequently used locations for trip directions in a tap. 

HERE’S WHAT THEY’RE SAYING
""Gives you the best route to where you want to go"" - New York Times
“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times
“Killer app” - Wall Street Journal
""MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit"" - Boston Globe
“A one-stop-shop” - Washington Post

AND HERE’S THE WORD FROM PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS
“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car.”
“Blows Google Maps out of the water.”
“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”

5 GREAT THINGS ABOUT TRANSIT:

1) THE BEST REAL-TIME DATA
Using the best transit agency data sources, and our fancy ETA prediction engine, we give you the most accurate real-time info possible for all transit modes -  including buses, subways, trains, streetcars, metros, ferries, ridehail and more. Prefer to travel on two wheels? With GPS, you can see live bikeshare and scooter locations right on the map. 

2) TRAVEL OFFLINE
Bus schedules, stop locations, subway maps and even our trip planner are available offline.

3) POWERFUL TRIP PLANNING
See fast and easy trips combining buses, subways and trains – the app even suggests routes that combine multiple options in one trip like bus + bike or scooter + metro. You’ll find great trip plans that you never even considered! Don’t like to walk a lot or use a certain mode or transit agency? Personalize your travel in the settings.  

4) GO: OUR STEP-BY-STEP NAVIGATOR*
Receive departure alarms to catch your bus or train, and get alerted when it’s time to get off or transfer. When using GO, you’ll also crowdsource more accurate info and real-time ETAs for other passengers– and rack up points and thank yous for being the most helpful rider on your line.  

5) USER REPORTS
See what other riders have to say! With millions of users contributing, you’ll get helpful info on crowding levels, on-time performance, the closest subway exits, and more.
