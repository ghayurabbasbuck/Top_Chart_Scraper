What people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:

- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.
by jefffafa123

- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!
by AndyLPhoto

- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!
by AwesomeV01

- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.
