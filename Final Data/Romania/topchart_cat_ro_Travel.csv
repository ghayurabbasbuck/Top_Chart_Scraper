Poți plăti parcarea pentru mașina ta folosind orice card de debit sau de credit emis în România, pe care trebuie să îl introduci o singură dată, la plata unei parcari, ca apoi să îl poți folosi ori de câte ori vrei. 
Este o soluție de plată a parcării la fel de inteligentă ca smartphone-ul tău, care te protejează de amenzi de parcare și îți oferă mai mult timp și liniște când esti în oraș. 

Cum folosești aplicația: 3 pași ca să parchezi liniștit în oraș

(1) Găsești parcare
Strada e detectată automat. Vei vedea cât costă ora de parcare în acea zonă. 
Descoperă și cel mai rapid traseu auto până la parcarea de interes.
Și vei știi exact cum să te întorci la mașină. De oriunde ai fi. 

(2) Alegi durata parcării
Nu stii exact cât o să ai treabă în oraș? Nici o problemă.
Alegi orice durată peste 30 minute și o poți prelugi oricând automat sau manual, de oriunde, fără griji. Durata minimă de parcare diferă in funcție de locație.

(3) Plăteși și zâmbești
Îți adaugi cardul doar la prima plată și apoi plătești parcările următoare instant. 
Poți achiziționa credite direct din aplicație sau prin stațiile de plată SelfPay, pentru a le folosi la plata parcării. Valoarea unui credit este de 1 Ron.
E super simplu, rapid. 

De ce să folosești AmParcat./ro/

Practic, această soluție mobilă simplă și eficientă de plată a parcării îți oferă o mulțime de funcționalități tipice și utile: 
îți recunoaște automat locația pe hartă și îți spune dacă ești într-o zonă cu parcare platită, cât costă și între ce ore trebuie să plătești. Pentru acestea, singura condiție este să dai acces aplicației la locația ta. 
îți oferă posibilitatea de a iniția traseu auto până la parcarea de interes;

îți afișează pentru anumite parcări numărul de locuri liber așa cum este el recepționat de la operatorul parcării;

chiar dacă nu ești în mașină în acel moment, poți alege strada pe care ai parcat și poți plăti parcarea de oriunde ai fi.

îți dă posibilitatea să plătești parcarea folosind orice card de debit, credit sau prin utilizarea creditelor.

îți afișează în mod simplu și foarte intuitiv cât timp mai ai din parcarea deja plătită.

primești notificări înainte de expirarea unei parcari.

poți prelungi o parcare în curs oricând și de oriunde, fară să mai introduci datele cardului.

poți folosi funcția de Prelungire Automată a parcării și stai liniștit pana ți-ai terminat treaba in zona. Opțiunea este valabilă doar pentru plata cu credite.

poți folosi aceeași aplicație pentru mai multe mașini.

îti arată pe hartă unde ai parcat și te ghidează înapoi la mașină.

ai posibilitatea salvării unei copii foto sau .pdf ale documentelor (RCA, Casco, ITP, rovinietă) aferente autovehiculelor din cont și a datelor de expirare pentru RCA, Casco, ITP, rovinietă, asistența rutiera, carnet de șofer, trusă medicală si extinctor. Primești notificari de fiecare data cand orice document/componentă se apropie de data de expirare.

poți transfera credite între utilizatorii AmParcat (transferul implică ca atat expeditorul cât si destinatarul sa aibă numerele de telefon salvate in aplicație).

poți înregistra și contoriza punctele de penalizare primite, suspendarea permisului auto, utilizarea dovezii de circulație și extinderea ei.

posibilitatea de descărcare a rapoartului cu privire la istoricul parcărilor și a raportului autoturismelor utilizate.

posibilitatea introducerii datelor de facturare și de a primi pe mail factura aferentă parcărilor efectuate.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.
