ro,Romania,Books,6018,9,980233813,Biblia Cornilescu - Română,Oleg Shukalovich,https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/biblia-cornilescu-rom%C3%A2n%C4%83/id980233813?uo=4,0.0,4.87024,3807,Book,"Biblia Română (Romanian Holy Bible)
Cornilescu (1921)
Dumitru Cornilescu (n. 4 aprilie 1891, comuna Slașoma, județul Mehedinți - d. 1975, Elveția) a fost ierodiacon și autor al unei traduceri în limba română a Bibliei, publicată în 1921, traducere care este în prezent cea mai răspândită traducere în rândul confesiunilor protestante (inclusiv cele neoprotestante).
Biblia (din lb. greacă βιβλίον, pl. βιβλία -cărți) se referă la scripturile sacre din iudaism și creștinism. Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.
Prima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul ""palaia diathékè""). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (""Legea lui Moise"", ""Pentateucul"", adică primele ""cinci cărți"" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.
Prima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”.",2015-04-05T00:49:20Z,2023-03-04T18:13:02Z

Shifted Fate
Amy was the Luna of her pack, growing a pup in her stomach when the alpha betrayed her and took her life, and that of her pup. When she woke up six years earlier she decided to change everything. Revenge would be something she focused on.

Justice For Juniper
""Your husband cheated with my wife,"" her boss said. Juniper froze, watching the betrayal on screen, pain tearing through her belly. “My baby...” When she woke again, she saw the three powerful men rushing into her room filled with regret and desire... 

Mated to Two Bad Boy Alphas
Ever since Lia spilled juice on Zane Adams at six, his friends made her life miserable—but when the mysterious Blake shows up to protect her, everything changes. Now, both boys want her…and on her sixteenth birthday, she hears them both growl “mine.” 

Tempting The Mafia Twins
My Mafia husband slept with the woman who killed our baby, and his sister filmed it.  
I tipped off the FBI about his crimes and fled his insane mob family.  
Now, he's locked down the entire city just to hunt me down. 

The Pack's Doctor
Yara is a werewolf, hiding in a human university, studying medicine. One day, when Yara is out letting her wolf run, she comes across Alpha Warren, caught in a bear trap. She saves him, but surprisingly finds out he was her mate.  Warren, a strong and powerful Alpha, finally finds his mate. He's unwilling to let her go, so he took Yara to his pack.
