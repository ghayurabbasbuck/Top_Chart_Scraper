Добавьте в почту аккаунты из других почтовых клиентов: Яндекс.Почта, Microsoft Outlook, Gmail от Google, Hotmail, Rambler, Yahoo — и переключайтесь между ними в один клик.

Краткий пересказ длинного письма. Поручите нейросети в приложении Mail прочитать все длинные электронные письма и кратко пересказать вам контекст, чтобы не терять время.

Выгодные даты для отпуска в Календаре. Календарь подскажет, в какой месяц лучше уйти в отпуск и какие дни лучше в него включить — выберите вкладку «Год» и введите свою зарплату.

Управляйте уведомлениями о новых электронных письмах. Настройте только нужные пуши и сообщения в приложении Mail: выберите нужные папки и удобное время.

Аккаунты всех почтовых клиентов в одном приложении. Соберите все письма из почты в одном приложении — читайте входящие письма, которые приходят вам в Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail от Google, Яндекс.Почта, Hotmail, Rambler и Zimbra в один клик.

Переводы на другие языки. Добавили удобный переводчик электронной почты. Пригодится, если читаете иностранную рассылку или отправляете бизнес-почту за границу. Просто откройте рассылку или напишите текст и выберите язык — перевод отобразится мгновенно.

Планер для ваших дел. Встречи по работе, напоминания о важных датах, чек-листы, звонки. Ссылка на звонок — в один клик, когда добавляете встречу в рабочий календарь.

Облако — безопасное место для документов и фото. Облако Mail сохранит файлы из писем, найдёт сканы документов. Загрузите все фото и видео в Облако, чтобы освободить память смартфона.

Тёмный фон в приложении Mail для комфортной работы. Выберите яркую заставку для Облака для работы днем, а ночью используйте темный интерфейс для просмотра файлов в Почте.

Контакты из адресной книги и почтовых клиентов в вашем приложении. Выбирайте, кому отправить письмо — приложение Mail предложит контакты из адресной книги и всех аккаунтов в вашей почте.

Быстрые действия с письмом. Разбирайте письма в приложении и в браузере: отметьте новое электронное письмо как важное, переместите в новую папку, удалите или оставьте непрочитанным. Добавьте в приложение Mail аккаунты других почтовых клиентов: Rambler, Gmail от Google, Яндекс.Почта, Microsoft Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo.

All our servers are available at maximum speed for all f3 VPN app users.
We do not store or transfer your data to anyone. At the same time, we try to ensure your safety and speed on the Internet as much as possible.

FOR WHAT?
• Using public Wi-Fi networks in cafes, bars, the subway and other public transport, your data stored on the device often becomes available to cyber fraudsters. Often, criminals can gain access to your information. f3 VPN Proxy will increase the protection of your device from unauthorized data interception.

• When transferring files, photos and text information on social networks or instant messengers, you must enable VPN in our application, thereby protecting your confidential data.

• Using a VPN, you can get rid of intrusive advertising based on your search history, since the f3 VPN application will hide your real IP address, and many sites will not be able to find out about your preferences and life plans.

• Not satisfied with the Internet speed? Try connecting to VPN from f3 and services will be available at maximum speed.

WHY US?
- We use some of the fastest servers in different regions of the world and are ready to share with you.
- Always the maximum speed on servers in different locations.
- Connect to VPN quickly with the click of a button.
- Maximum simple settings, anyone can handle it.
