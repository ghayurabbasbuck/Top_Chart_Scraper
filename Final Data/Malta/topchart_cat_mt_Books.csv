Shifted Fate
Amy was the Luna of her pack, growing a pup in her stomach when the alpha betrayed her and took her life, and that of her pup. When she woke up six years earlier she decided to change everything. Revenge would be something she focused on.

Justice For Juniper
""Your husband cheated with my wife,"" her boss said. Juniper froze, watching the betrayal on screen, pain tearing through her belly. “My baby...” When she woke again, she saw the three powerful men rushing into her room filled with regret and desire... 

Mated to Two Bad Boy Alphas
Ever since Lia spilled juice on Zane Adams at six, his friends made her life miserable—but when the mysterious Blake shows up to protect her, everything changes. Now, both boys want her…and on her sixteenth birthday, she hears them both growl “mine.” 

Tempting The Mafia Twins
My Mafia husband slept with the woman who killed our baby, and his sister filmed it.  
I tipped off the FBI about his crimes and fled his insane mob family.  
Now, he's locked down the entire city just to hunt me down. 

The Pack's Doctor
Yara is a werewolf, hiding in a human university, studying medicine. One day, when Yara is out letting her wolf run, she comes across Alpha Warren, caught in a bear trap. She saves him, but surprisingly finds out he was her mate.  Warren, a strong and powerful Alpha, finally finds his mate. He's unwilling to let her go, so he took Yara to his pack.
