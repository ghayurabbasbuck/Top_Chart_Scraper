Trusted by 100,000+ weight lifters, Train Fitness is the future of AI + gym workouts.

Our application monitors the motion of your Apple Watch, tracking reps for over 470 unique exercise types – completely hands free! Our app will track push ups, bicep curls, 12 types of bench press, squats, deadlifts, and hundreds more! No more manually logging each set.

This automatic tracking is made possible by our patented Neural Kinetic Profiling, an advancement in AI that allows workout tracking using wrist motion. 

Unsure what to do at the gym? Using the Train Fitness app, you can generate workouts based on your recovery, goals, and fitness data with the help of AI. Our Smart Weights system will recommend specific workout plans, exercises, sets, and weight… entirely customized to you! Let artificial intelligence build the best possible workout for you, and stop guessing what to do at the gym.  

We built Train Fitness because we too are lifters, gym enthusiasts, & fellow athletes, and we're tired of entering a workout log, manually. We believe that a gym workout tracker should be as easy as recording a run, and we’ll stop at nothing to get there. The Train Fitness App is an all-encompassing workout log app that tracks how you move and helps you achieve your strength training goals at the gym. Simply strap on your Apple Watch, and see the magic unfold.

Our application runs on the Apple Watch 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, SE, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Unfortunately, we do not support the Apple Watch 1, 2 and 3.

We are very serious about data. Train Fitness will never sell your data to third parties. Our data storage practices are designed to enhance user experience without compromising privacy. We only retain the essential data needed for a seamless experience. Please see our Privacy Policy & Commitment below for more details.

Weight management sounds simple: consume fewer calories than you burn to lose weight, and more to gain. But balancing these factors can be challenging. Our AI-powered food recognition technology takes the guesswork out of calorie tracking, so you can focus on your goals with ease. We created this app to be your supportive companion in reaching your weight management goals, making the process simpler and more efficient.
