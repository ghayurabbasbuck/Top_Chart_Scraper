Here it is! With NordVPN, one tap is all you need to change your IP address, protect your browsing from snoopers, and enjoy the internet the way it was meant to be.

NordVPN is an easy-to-use VPN app for an iPhone or iPad, trusted by millions of users worldwide. It shields your online activities from nosy advertisers, cybercriminals, and intrusive internet service providers. How? By stopping trackers and encrypting your traffic to make it unreadable to anyone trying to take a peek at your browsing. 

Why NordVPN?

TURBO SPEEDS

We do everything we can to give you VPN connection speeds that are hard to beat. That includes creating custom protocols so you can have super-fast connections without sacrificing security.

GET HELP 24/7

Whatever it is — app issues, VPN connection problems, or payment options — we’ll sort it. Browse the Support Center, write an email, or visit our website for a live chat with customer support. 

POWERFUL ONLINE SECURITY

NordVPN secures your iPhone data with next-generation encryption algorithms. It would take millions of years to decrypt — so you know the information you send and receive is safe. 

STAY SAFE ON PUBLIC WI-FI

Found a cozy cafe with a Wi-Fi hotspot, but it’s unsecured? Don’t give up! Use our VPN and hide your online activities from snoopers and hackers.

THOUSANDS OF VPN SERVERS

Lightning-fast VPN protocols sure help, but our vast server network is there to do the heavy lifting. Thousands of VPN servers covering 160+ countries mean that the perfect one is always just a tap away. 

PROTECT TEN DEVICES WITH ONE ACCOUNT

Your iPhone is probably not your only device that needs VPN protection. Use NordVPN to secure your laptop, tablet, and smart TV, or share your account with your family.

Features our users love:

• Strong VPN encryption for top-grade security.
• Unlimited VPN data for internet freedom.
• VPN protocols to choose from: NordLynx based on WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2/IPsec (for manual connections).
