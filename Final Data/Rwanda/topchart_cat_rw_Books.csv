The Holy Bible (Bibiliya Yera) comes with both the new testament and the old testaments of the holy scriptures. 

Christianity was introduced to Rwanda primarily by European missionaries starting in the late 19th century. Initially, missionaries used European languages like French to spread their message and teach the Bible. They wanted to translate the Bible in its local language for people in Rwanda, so the Kinyarwanda Bible (bibiliya kinyarwanda) was found for the Christians in Rwanda.

The first attempt to translate the Bible into Kinyarwanda (Bibiliya mu Kinyarwanda) began in the early 20th century. But the entire Kinyarwanda Bible translation took several decades to complete. The New Testament into Kinyarwanda Sacred Book was published in 1952.

The Kinyarwanda Holy Bible (bibiliya yera kinyarwanda bible) played a significant role in the growth and spread of Christianity in Rwanda. The Kinyarwanda Scriptures were used for both personal devotion and church services. 

Engaging in Kinyarwanda Bible study, many Rwandan Christians have found solace and guidance by reading the verses. Many people will find reading comfortable, whereas some may prefer the audio Bible. Whether reading or listening, Bible verses will always give us peace, harmony, and guidelines for a way of life.

The vision for this app was much bigger and more detailed, but my current skills limited what I could achieve. I sincerely apologize for any bugs, grammatical errors, or inconveniences you may encounter. I am not a professional app developer—just a student in another field of computer science who wanted to contribute using my free time and basic skills.

If anyone is able to improve this app further, your contribution would be greatly appreciated. I believe such support will truly bless this ministry.
