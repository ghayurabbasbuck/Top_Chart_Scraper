Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.
- The subscription automatically renews. The renewal cost will be charged to your account 24 hours before the end of the current subscription, if auto-renewal has not been turned off.
- You can easily manage subscriptions in your Apple account settings – for example, turn off automatic subscription renewal right after purchase.

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!


Growing up is not easy! But we support parents and children every day on this exciting journey.

It’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity, such as picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

SEE YOUR WORKOUTS
Get insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route and more for your runs, walks and bike rides.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS
See your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT
All physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favourite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity that your other apps didn’t track – from aerobics to Zumba!

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVOURITE APPS AND DEVICES
Google Fit can show you info from many of your favourite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace and more.

CHECK IN AT ANY TIME, FROM ANYWHERE
