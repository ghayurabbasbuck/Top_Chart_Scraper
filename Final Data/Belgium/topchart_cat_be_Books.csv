Aussi je vous recommande ""Concordance Biblique"" - vous trouver dans mes applications.
Après la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.
Jusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.
La Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues ""originelles"", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.
La version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux.",2015-03-25T02:11:31Z,2023-05-16T00:33:11Z
