Jouer doit rester un plaisir – et nous y veillons ensemble !


La Loterie Nationale : notre engagement pour un Jeu Responsable
La Loterie Nationale s’est toujours engagée à protéger les joueurs et sa politique de ‘Jeu Responsable’ fait partie intégrante de sa stratégie d’entreprise.


Qu’entendons-nous par Jeu Responsable ?
Aux yeux de la Loterie Nationale, le Jeu Responsable doit circonscrire le développement d’habitudes de jeu excessives et protéger les mineurs. À cette fin, nous appliquons une série de mesures – en réalité, la Loterie Nationale remplit un rôle préventif et éducatif, qu’elle prend très au sérieux.


Nos produits sont destinés au plaisir et à la détente. Nous savons cependant que certains joueurs se laissent parfois aller à des excès ... et ont donc du mal à contrôler leur envie de jouer.
Résultat : ils risquent de devenir dépendants au jeu. Il est donc prioritaire pour la Loterie Nationale de sensibiliser le grand public.

Sinterklaas is zoals elk jaar weer bereikbaar op je mobiel of tablet. Perfect voor ouders om hun stoute (en lieve!) kinderen met Sinterklaas te laten bellen en appen*.

Deze app bevat drie leuke en handige functies:

-= De Sint belt op =-
Laat de Sint opbellen* om een kind streng toe te spreken, of juist aan te moedigen! De reden voor het gesprek kan geselecteerd worden. De Sint kan ook Pakjesavond op een originele manier inluiden door te vertellen waar de pakjes liggen, of om te vertellen waar de eerste aanwijzing van de speurtocht ligt.

-= Voicemail van Sinterklaas =-
- Geef de namen van stoute, of juist lieve, kinderen door zodat de Sint ze in zijn Grote Boek kan schrijven
- Hoor hoeveel nachtjes slapen het nog is tot Pakjesavond
- Geef je verlanglijstje door aan Sinterklaas
- Hoor wat de Sint aan het doen is
- Laat een bericht achter

-= Appen met de Sint =-
Je kunt nu de Sint berichtjes sturen, en je krijgt meteen antwoord terug. De Sint is altijd in voor een leuk gesprek, dus vraag maar raak!

-= Hulp nodig? =-
