► 4 GOOD REASONS TO USE DOKTR 

Like +300,000 other Belgians, download the Doktr app and quickly speak to a doctor or psychologist online via video consultation! The benefits of Doktr at a glance:

No need to leave your place. No stress in traffic or through crowded waiting rooms. You just do the teleconsultation wherever you feel most comfortable or while traveling abroad. 

• Secure digital access 

Log in securely with itsme® and experience peace of mind. All video consultations are fully secured with end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing your privacy. 

• Fast medical advice 

You can quickly speak to an available doctor via a video call. 95% of our patients receive medical advice within 25 minutes. 

 

► HOW DOES IT WORK? 

1. Log in securely with itsme. 

2. Consult an available GP or psychologist by choosing one of the symptoms or speak to your own GP via 'speak to my regular GP'. 

3. Answer some short questions about your health conditions. 

4. The doctor or psychologist sends you a message and starts the video consultation through the app. 

5. Receive a summary of your consultation and all the necessary documents in the app. Has the doctor prescribed a prescription and/or a absence certificate? You can find them in the app or on your ID-card. A follow-up interview with the psychologist can also be scheduled together.

Infections - Respiratory problems - Allergy - Skin problems (rashes, acne, eczema, psoriasis, cold sores ...) - Cough - Fever - Flu - Childhood illnesses - Insect and tick bites - Headache - Abdominal pain - Pill prescription - Earache - Mental health 

If, after the consultation, the doctor judges that you need medication for your symptoms, he/she will provide you with the appropriate prescription. If you are too sick to work, you will receive a medical certificate through the app. 

For mental health problems like these, you can also contact a psychologist:  

Depression - Stress - Anxiety - Insecurity - Burn out - Relationship problems - Trauma - Bereavement - Fatigue - Lethargy - Addiction - Eating disorders - Fear of failure - Insomnia - Etc.

Has this ever happened to you? You find someone unconscious. Without thinking about it, you call 112. A woman answers your call and asks you where you are. You tell here you are in the woods, but than you realize that you don't really know your exact location. There a no street signs and no points of recognition, which makes it impossible to explain where you need help. While figuring out where exactly you are, many valuable minutes have passed.

From now on, you don't have to worry about that anymore by installing the 112 App. While calling, the 112 App will automatically:
1. Display your GPS coordinates on your screen;
2. Display your address information on your screen (if a network connection is established)

From now on, if you are in the situation where you are in an emergency, you can simply answer the question 'Where are you' by reading the information off your screen.

This is the simplest-to-use contraction timer. The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.
If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.

Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.
