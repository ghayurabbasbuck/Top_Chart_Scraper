Met de paarse zwevende ‘actie’-knop gaat u rechtstreeks naar handige functionaliteiten zoals overschrijvingen, betalen of geld ontvangen via een QR-code (Payconiq) of een betaalverzoek sturen via WhatsApp, sms of e-mail.

Uiteraard kunt u als klant met de Crelan Mobile-app makkelijk: 

•	een rekening openen (zicht- en spaarrekening),
•	een debetkaart aanvragen,
•	snel verrichtingen uitvoeren en beheren,
