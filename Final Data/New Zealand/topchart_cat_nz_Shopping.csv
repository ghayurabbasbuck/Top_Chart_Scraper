Welcome to The Warehouse app, the online home of everyday low prices in New Zealand. Pretty much everything Kiwis need in their daily lives – fashion, technology, homewares – is right here, under one roof (or rather, one app). Plus, some cool app-only features that you won’t find in our stores.

For fashionistas, there are tonnes of great style statements for women, men and kids. Homemakers can choose from the latest, chic homeware styles and heaps of great toys for kids (or adults, no judgments here). Gamers, pick “app” all the new titles and expansions (and a bigger TV to go with it) without moving an inch from your gaming chair! And all this at app-solutely cheap prices!

Choose from over 50,000 products and get them delivered or pick them up from your nearest store using Click & Collect (free for anything not oversized!). Or simply add items to your Wishlist and buy at your own convenience.

Also, on the app are a few exclusive features:
•	Cool online-only deals
•	The stock availability feature where you can check if an item is in stock (quite handy if you’re planning to drive over to your nearest store and pick it up)
•	Special online deals and offers
•	The price scanner where you can scan a product in-store and know exactly how low our low prices are! 

Everyone gets a bargain at The Warehouse. Drop in and get one now!",2014-03-16T21:21:26Z,2025-11-16T20:42:12Z
