At Xero, protecting your data is fundamental to everything we do. Just one easily guessed password can stop your business in its tracks. So Xero has put an extra deadbolt on the door to help keep your data secure.


This is why Xero uses MFA to secure logins. It significantly reduces the risk of someone gaining access to your account, even if they've managed to obtain your email and password through a phishing attack or malware.


The Xero Verify app is simple to use. You can receive push notifications for fast authentication, instead of having to open the app and enter a code into Xero when you login. Simply accept the notification on your device's home screen - it's that easy.


Features:

* Sign into your Xero account using push notifications on your device (if enabled).

* Generate six digit verification codes, even if you don't have a network or mobile connection.

* Use Xero Verify to authenticate your Xero account (it can't be used on other products outside Xero)

* Easy set up using QR code
