Recreational adventures involving the coastal waters in New Zealand are something most people enjoy. In order to make the most out of those moments by the coast you need to use the NZ Tides app. It will tell you the information you need to know in order to fish better, catch ideal surf waves, enjoy some boating, or walk along the beach. 

In the app, you will have access to the times and heights of the tides for 256 locations around New Zealand. The tide data is also built in to the app so there is no need to have internet access to get the information you need. That means you can go off the grid and still know pertinent tide information for your chosen location. 

An exciting feature of this app is the “Near Me” search screen, which will show your current location, as well as tide information for available nearby locations. It’s a one stop resource for ensuring you can optimise your outdoor experience for what you enjoy doing most. Without a doubt, all Kiwis’ will be putting this app on their Favourites list.
