""The lessons are quick, fun (the Egyptian section with the tweets between the gods made me and my 12-year-old chuckle), clever - and genuinely interesting. My kid and I will go through lessons together - it’s interesting enough to keep his attention, and I’m learning new things too. Not too advanced for him, or remedial for me. I’ve enjoyed all the lessons - logic (the infinite hotel theory was great), art, math, and history. It is indeed much more enjoyable than doom scrolling. I encourage you to take a chance, I’m hooked. Please keep the new lessons coming!"" — BustedKate

HOW DOES IT WORK?

After you decide to learn with Nibble and download the app, you can choose a subscription plan most suitable for your goals.

The Nibble subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each month, 3 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the selected option) until you cancel. Canceling your subscription means the automatic renewal will be disabled. However, you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period.

If you start a free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial.

Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.

With our care plans, you will learn how to identify a plant, how often to water your trees, or why the leaf on your flower turned brown.

We have a wide variety of features that every green thumb would fall in love with: 

► Watering Calculator

This feature will help to figure out the right amount of water your green pet needs. You just need to answer several questions regarding your plant’s conditions, and voila! 

► Light Meter

Here is another helpful tool that calculates the correct lighting level for your greens! Just click the Light Meter button and point the camera at the plant. Our AR-based technology will automatically scan the nearest environment, measure the amount of light, and tell if you need to move the plant to a brighter or shadier spot. 

► Care Plans

Plantkeeping will become even more effortless with our Personalized Care Plans. Request a plan for almost any species, from common houseplants to exotic cultivars. Your Snake plant care needs some improvements, or maybe you just got your first air plant and are not sure what to do with it? Get thorough watering, fertilization, lighting, and even pruning instructions easily and make ‘em grow!

► Care Notifications

Our users say that our plant care app helps with organizing daily routines! Keep calm – we will send your reminders to make sure that all your green pets are following their watering and fertilization schedules. Moreover, there are special weather notifications so that you will be warned in case of storms, freezing temperatures, and other unfavorable conditions that may harm your outdoor oasis.
 
► Ask the Botanist

Use this feature to get a consultation with our experienced gardening experts. Ask any questions regarding houseplant care and get custom recommendations, step-by-step guides, useful hints, and detailed instructions for your particular case.

Last but not least, we are happy to present our latest update: 

► Mushroom Identification

Our fresh mushroom identifier will become a fav feature for every single shroom hunter! While designed to identify fungi online in several taps, we have implemented a technology for offline id: no more hesitation while outdoors in lush woods. Identify edible mushrooms for delicious dinners, learn new fungi species, and use our feature to detect poisonous specimens.

PlantIn was created to provide loving care for each of your green pets, so let’s make this world greener and educate ourselves on botany together! Stay plantuned for more lifesaving info from our plant care app.
