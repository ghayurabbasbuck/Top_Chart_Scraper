Single publishers report facts, but no outlet is free from bias. To solve this, we built Drooid.

Drooid collects news articles from many reputable sources and gives short summaries from all sides, so you see the full picture faster. With In-Depth AI analysis, you get a clear view of what happened, why it matters, and how different outlets cover it.
On Drooid, you’re not just a passive reader; you can comment, share how you feel, and add context to the news. Your comments help the community understand the news better. Every comment appears in a community feed. With community, you can understand how people are feeling about the news; here, the news becomes more humane, rather than just some facts and statistics.

For full transparency, every summary links back to the original articles. That makes it easy to read original articles and share them right from the app. It serves two things: the readers get to know where the information is coming from, and the publishers get the traffic.

HOW DROOID WORKS
Collects articles from different reputable publishers and outlets
Uses AI to generate concise summaries that cover all sides
Adds additional historical context when it improves understanding
Attaches citations to each summary and links to sources
Gives you In-Depth news analysis with AI from multiple articles

WHAT YOU CAN DO
Read short summaries that present multiple perspectives
Access original articles
