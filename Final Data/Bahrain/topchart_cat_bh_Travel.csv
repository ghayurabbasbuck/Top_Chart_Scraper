No limits, no restrictions.

Simlo is a dedicated app for electronic data SIMs (eSIMs) that gives you a simple, flexible, and unrestricted connectivity experience. All Simlo data plans are truly unlimited — with no “fair usage” policy and no sudden speed drops after a certain limit.

Travel, browse, stream, and download freely without worrying about data limits or speed. This is the Internet you deserve when traveling.

Why choose Simlo?
• No fair usage policy  
• No data limits  
• No sudden speed reduction  
• No physical SIM cards  
• No waiting, shipping, or activation delays  
Everything is digital — activate your eSIM within minutes and stay connected anywhere in the world.

How to use the app:
1. Choose the plan that fits your destination and trip duration  
2. Install your eSIM on your device using the QR code  
3. Activate the plan and start using the Internet instantly  

Whether you're traveling to the Gulf, Europe, or anywhere around the world, you'll enjoy fast and reliable Internet — without worrying about disconnections or throttling.

What is “Fair Usage”?
Most providers advertise “unlimited” plans, but in reality, they limit your data after a certain amount through what’s known as a “Fair Usage Policy.” Once you reach that threshold, your Internet speed drops significantly.

At Simlo, we don’t follow this policy at all. Every Simlo plan gives you truly unlimited data at a stable speed — from the first megabyte to the last moment.

Where does Simlo work?
Simlo covers over 170 destinations worldwide, including:

• Gulf Region: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain  
• Arab World: Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia  
• Europe: France, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden
