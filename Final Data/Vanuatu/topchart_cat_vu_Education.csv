Unlock reading and writing potential with the literacy programme designed for kids and trusted by teachers worldwide. Aligned with the Science of Reading, this interactive app makes learning to read and write and building phonemic awareness fun and engaging!

What is Jolly Phonics?
Jolly Phonics is a programme for teaching reading and writing. It is based on a systematic synthetic phonics approach, and was developed by teachers Sue Lloyd and Sara Wernham. It is the first stage in teaching children to read and write using the 5 key skills. It focuses on direct, explicit instruction of phonemic awareness and phonics for both reading (decoding) and writing (encoding). Scientific research has consistently shown phonemic awareness to be essential for building strong reading, spelling and writing skills.

Why Choose Jolly Phonics?
1. Proven Success: Used in schools globally for over 30 years with proven literacy outcomes.
2. Science-Based Approach: Aligned with the Science of Reading to ensure kids build effective foundational reading and spelling skills.
3. Engaging and Multi-Sensory: Songs, actions and interactive learning games bring phonics learning to life!

Key Features That Make Learning Easy and Fun:
1. Explore All 42 Letter Sounds: Go beyond ABC with free songs and audio to help kids learn every sound.
2. Learn to Read: Build phonemic awareness with our interactive learning tools such as flashcards, wordbank and action images to enhance and support every lesson.
3. Learn to Write: Develop strong handwriting skills with step-by-step visual animations.
4. Learning Games: Learn to read and write with fun phonics learning games that reinforce kids' learning.
5. Progress Tracking: Built-in assessments to monitor children's progress and celebrate achievements.

Who Is Jolly Phonics For?
1. Kids: From preschoolers learning their first words and ABC, to confident young readers building their phonics skills.
2. Parents: Support your children's early reading, writing, and spelling journey at home with our guided lessons.
3. Teachers: A valuable classroom resource for phonics instruction.

Start Your Kids' Phonics Journey Today!
Join the millions of families and educators who have embraced the Jolly Phonics programme of learning for confident readers and writers. Whether at home or in the classroom, this app makes literacy learning simple, effective and enjoyable!

Why Phonics Instead of ABC?
1. Phonics focuses on letter-sound relationships and how sounds (phonemes) make up words. It teaches kids the valuable skill of decoding, which is essential for reading and spelling fluency.
2. ABC refers to learning letters and their names rather than their sounds. Knowing the alphabet may be a precursor to phonics but doesn't directly teach reading skills.

Learning Beyond ABC!
Jolly Phonics doesn't stop at just ABC or phonemic awareness. The app offers:
1. Advanced learning strategies
2. Comprehensive handwriting exercises
3. Fun learning games designed for children to reinforce spelling and letter sounds knowledge

WHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING ABOUT BIBLE STORIES FOR KIDS:

“My seven year old now always asks to listen to the Bible Stories app as we’re getting in the car. It’s so fun to have her listen to the stories that open up her imagination to learn more about God. The ability to have an engaging way to get our kids into Scripture without the need of them holding the phone is a game changer!” -Julie​​

""I might’ve cried the first time I opened and started exploring this app! All I could imagine is sitting with our little boy (and children to come) listening to all the stories from scripture while they color along .. what a DREAM!!! Children are sponges & it is our duty as parents to saturate them in the Truth of God’s Word.. this app helps us do just that! And in a way that is creative & FUN! So thankful The Lord laid this idea on their hearts so that we all can benefit from their obedience!"" -Tori

 “I love everything about this app. The concept of by kids for kids and the way these bible stories are delivered easily make it my favorite Bible app for kids (and we have used a ton of other ones). I have 6 kids (ages 1-11) and all of them found this app very engaging at their own level. I would highly recommend this app for all parents who want to raise godly children who love His Word.” -Reggie 

""The Bible Stories for Kids App is an absolute dream every parent and childcare worker has been waiting for!! It presents the Gospel in a creative, understandable, and purposeful way to kids of all ages. This app is so well produced that I find myself loving it being played in the background for my daughters. Your kids will delight in the Bible Stories for Kids App as it takes their imagination for a ride!"" - Rachel
