The NowServing app (by SeriousMD) was originally built to help inform you about your queue position, so you can make the most of your time. Roam around the mall, finish chores, have some coffee and go back to the clinic when it’s almost your turn.

With the current situation the country is in, we've brought out a ton of new features to better keep both you and your doctors safe.

Today, the NowServing app also gives you a way to:
* Book a schedule with your doctor
* Chat with your doctor's staff to ask for schedules or ask minor questions
* You can be notified if the doctor is already IN and has started clinic
* You will be notified if the doctor cancelled the clinic due to an emergency
* You can now do online video consultations with your doctor
* Save transcripts of your online consult
* Have access to the prescriptions and other files sent to you by your doctor
* Receive your lab results from Hi-Precision
* Order medicines online and get it delivered straight to where you are

We've also partnered with companies like Hi-Precision, Medicard, MedExpress and more to offer you more convenience. 

We've worked hard to bring you this app and we're continuing to work day in and day out on updates to better improve the app. We hope it'll be able to help you and your family. Keep safe!",2020-04-11T07:00:00Z,2025-10-17T08:13:16Z

ScanBaby is divided into three different modes:

-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.

-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.

-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.

Not too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!

Why should you try this app?

- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.
- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.
- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.
- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.
- Track your pregnancy journey. Get weekly insights on pregnancy symptoms, learn how to read ultrasound scans, monitor contractions, and keep track of your baby’s movements with a kick counter.

For best results:

- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.
- Use the app in a quiet room
- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)
- Put the phone in Airplane Mode
- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press ""Record"" to create a recording
- Use AirPods

Daily Anatomy Flashcards teaches healthcare students the 500 most important anatomical structures in a beginner-friendly format. The perfect entry into the world of anatomy!

*Reach your goals*

Starting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.

*What will you learn?*

With Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones.

Instead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in green in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.

*How to stay motivated and not forget*

Whether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.

It's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.

By using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.

Daily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can.",2020-04-10T07:00:00Z,2025-03-04T13:38:37Z
