Now, you can sing songs of praise and thanksgiving to God with all the lyrics you need in an elegantly designed app that doesn't display any ads.

Why develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?
Worship Songs was initially developed as we couldn't find an app with both Tamil and Transliterated (Romanised) text. 
Now, our vision has grown to bring all the good quality songs Tamil Christians use to praise and thank God in one easy to use app that doesn't display any advertisements.

Many Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well, so you need not look for another app. 

And finally, the song database grows rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. We would like to add a word that we are extremely careful in our song selection. We do not want to add all the songs out there in the wild but only good quality ones that's scriptural.

Did we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?

FEATURES

- A large collection of Tamil and English songs, Jebathotta Jeyageethangal, Keerthanaigal, Seyalveerar Geethangal (FMPB), Sarah Navaroji songs etc.
- Transliterated (Romanised) text for Tamil songs
- Songs grouped by Titles, Authors, Categories, Song Books
- Ability to quickly search for a song by its title or content or song number in a Song Book
- Manage your favourite list of songs through ""Favourites"". This will help you to organize songs that will be used in next Sunday service, Small Group meetings or simply to manage your favourite list.
- ""Present song"" on your TV or projector wireless (Miracast/WiDi) or via HDMI cable connection (MHL, SlimPort or Micro-HDMI port).
- YouTube video support for selected songs.
- Share your favourite song or a verse from a song to Whatsapp, Facebook etc
- Ability to use your own song database (in OpenLP db format) hosted in GitHub, Dropbox shared folder etc..
- Professional design with no ads.

FAQ

Q. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?

Refine your search terms. For example, instead of ""Arathanai"", try searching for ""Aarathanai"". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.

Q. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?

You can create a new issue at our Github project https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-db-dev. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.

Q. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?

The songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there. Or you can use the Feedback feature within the app to communicate with us.

Q. How do I report bugs?

Please create an issue and apply the label ""Bug"" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.

Q. How can I help you guys?

If you find Worship Songs to be useful, please give it a good rating and share your opinion. Please help others know about this app by spreading word. You can contribute song lyrics or if you are good at iOS development, you can contribute code.

Q. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?

Absolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya. 
If you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.

vu,Vanuatu,Books,6018,10,1357521492,Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji,Sukhpreet Singh,https://apps.apple.com/vu/app/sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji/id1357521492?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Book,"Guru Granth Sahib is the religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign, and eternal living Guru following the lineage of the ten human Gurus of the Sikh religion. Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur. This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

The text consists of 1430 angs (pages) and 6,000 shabads (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music. The bulk of the scripture is divided into thirty-one ragas, with each Granth raga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the ragas in which they are read. The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, in various languages, including Lahnda (Western Punjabi), Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Persian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.

Guru Granth Sahib was composed by seven Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Gobind Singh added 1 sloakh in mahala 9 Ang 1429. It also contains the traditions and teachings of Indian sants (saints), such as Ravidas, Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and two Muslim Sufi saints Bhagat Bhikan and Sheikh Farid.

The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind.",2020-04-15T07:00:00Z,2024-02-19T16:52:25Z
