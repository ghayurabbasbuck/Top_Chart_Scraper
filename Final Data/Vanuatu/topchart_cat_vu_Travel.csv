HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Reach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!

Ride safely
Safety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.

Smart destinations
Yango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!

Multiple destinations, one route
Yango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. 

Request rides for close ones
Show you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.

Refer friends and get discounts
Invite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.

Thousands of travel videos saved across your Instagram and TikTok… and zero time to turn them into a plan? You can’t search those folders, you keep rewatching clips to find the exact spot, pinning places on Google Maps takes forever, and spreadsheets don’t tell you how far anything is. We get it. Trip planning from scratch is painful—and your saved folder is begging to be used.

Roamy fixes the mess. With one tap, pull every location mentioned in a video, drop them onto a map, and see your entire collection of spots—clearly, visually, and all in one place. When you’re ready to go, just tell Roamy how many days you have. We’ll build a sensible, day-by-day itinerary that connects the dots for you. Trip planning, minus the stress.

Who Roamy is for
- You’ve got dozens of folders and thousands of saved travel posts across Instagram and TikTok.
- You love picking the spots—but hate the logistics.
- You want everything in one place: your saved locations, a clean map, and a plan that actually fits your days.

How it works

- 1-tap save from socials: Import places from TikTok/Instagram with a single click. Roamy detects locations mentioned in the video and adds them for you.
- See everything on a map: No more scattered folders or notes. Your saved spots appear on a clean map so you can visualize your trip at a glance.
- Your master collection: Keep every restaurant, landmark, café, and hidden gem in one organized list—with links back to the original posts and reviews.
