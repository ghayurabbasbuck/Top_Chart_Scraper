Hello! Welcome to Kandy Magazine. First, thank you to the 1% who clicked  ...more. When I founded Kandy 14 years ago, I had a simple mission - deliver a new kind of men's magazine. A magazine which was more visual than words. Our first 2012 iPad issue delivered. A year later our first iPhone issue raised the bar. We told stories visually more than textually. We were a hit!

In our early years, we kept to this vision, consistently publishing pictorials which told the story. A photo and a cute blurb or brief caption. As we grew in popularity - yes it is true that in 2014 we were the most popular magazine in the app store, more popular than People, Cosmo, Men's Health and GQ - higher profile celebrities desired the exposure Kandy delivered. To accommodate, we moved away from our fun, creative visual magazine towards your traditional, boring editorial magazine. That was our first mistake. 

Shortly thereafter, the new layout caught the attention of potential ad reps who advised we tone down the sexy and increase the text in articles. That was our second mistake. It did not take long for our readership to drop and our global audience as well. 

To be fair, our decline was not all self-induced. In our rocket ship rise to the top of the app store rankings, we maximized Apple's newsstand app exposure. It was where you went to discover magazines, much in the way when you would walk into a bookstore or by a street vendor magazine newsstand. It showed the current cover of the most recent issue and with our magazine covers who would not be intrigued to check out Kandy. However, in a perfect storm of events outside our influence, big publishers sold their private newsstand app to Apple which turned it into what you know today as News+. Kandy is excluded. 


Starting now, we are returning to our photo story issues. More girls, more photos, less words. What you wanted in the beginning and what you want today. We are not an adult magazine, there is no nudity. Our photos are classic glamour, bikini swimsuit and lingerie. I hope you enjoy Kandy.

They say every picture tells a story. Kandy digital / mobile magazine lets pictures tell the story. It is for men who enjoy Live Sports events, fitness and exercise programs combined with the latest men's fashion and watch style. You will become a Kandy magazine subscriber to the app.

If you are only fans of of Premier Leagues, UEFA or NFL football or enjoy F1, Rugby and Golf and the scores as well, Kandy magazine has all your live sporting interests covered.

Of course, any real man enjoys a wide range of topics, Kandy delivers what you need. Current trends for men's fashion, style and the hottest Rolex, Omega, Tag Heuer, Patek Philippe watches men are buying.

Are you old school, classic lads magazine reader who loved Loaded, Maxim magazine, FHM, Esquire, Nuts, Front, Zoo, Men's Health, Stuff and GQ? Kandy rolls all that good Stuff into its digital issues optimized for both iPads and iPhones.
