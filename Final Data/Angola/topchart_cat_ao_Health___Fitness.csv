Luvu is a cute, emotional marshmallow who auto-tracks your exercises and pushes you - in wholesome, slightly unhinged ways - to move more. Whether you’re doing bodyweight strength, cardio bursts, yoga, stretching, or mobility work, Luvu turns your at-home workout into a game you actually want to play.

Designed for every level - from absolute beginner to “I need to feel the burn” - Luvu gives you real-time feedback, progress that sticks, and wild reward moments that keep you coming back.

What you get with Luvu:

• Auto-tracked workouts - Luvu uses your camera to quietly (and privately) sense movement, count reps, and give feedback so you don’t have to manually log anything.
• Lots of workout types - Squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, yoga flows, stretches, mobility drills, and adaptive combos based on how you’re feeling.
• Personalized progression - Workouts scale with you. Luvu learns your rhythm, challenges you just enough, and helps you build consistency.
• Game-like retention - Earn XP, keep streaks alive, unlock emotes, power up with energy refills, and defend your progress with clever streak savers.
• Emotional accountability - Supportive, snarky, or unhinged - Luvu’s coaching tones keep things fresh. Sometimes it’s a hug, sometimes it’s a playful shove.
• Daily challenges and rituals - Small, bite-sized wins that compound, plus surprise celebrations when you crush it.
• Friendly rivalries and milestones - See your progress, compare with past self (and optionally friends), and earn meaningful badges.
• Customizable experience - Tailor how Luvu shows up: the vibe, intensity, and reward style.

Whether you’re starting from scratch, resetting after a break, or chasing a new personal best, Luvu turns habit-building into something you actually look forward to.

Why Luvu?

• Built to stick. Smart pacing, feedback loops, and reward momentum - so you don’t just start; you keep going.
• Personality that motivates. Luvu isn’t a bland coach - he’s emotional, relentless, kind of chaotic, and obsessed with your consistency.
• Effortless tracking. No manual logging. Just show up, move, and let Luvu handle the rest.
• Progress you can feel. Real metrics, real improvements, and celebrations that feel earned (and sometimes delightfully over-the-top).

Try Luvu Plus
Upgrade to Luvu Plus for premium perks: unlimited energy refills, streak savers, exclusive coaching voices, deeper customization, and faster progression. Start with a free trial to experience the full-powered version of your accountability partner.
