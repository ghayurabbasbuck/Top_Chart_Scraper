FAQ:
- Why is it free?
   Since it is not originally for commercial purposes, it is made available for free.
   I'm thinking about running ads to cover the maintenance costs, and I'm just implementing them, but I don't have the best space to display them, so I don't have any plans to run them at the moment.

- Who is developing it and why?
   Development started using Flutter by engineers who enjoy shooting to explore technology and manage their own shooting performance.

- Where is the data stored?
   Data is only stored on your device.
   We have not built a dedicated server because of the running costs.
   That's why I chose QR codes to share data with friends.

- What are your plans for the future?
   We have more overseas users than expected, so we plan to continue updating the version regularly.",2021-11-10T08:00:00Z,2025-09-02T12:37:05Z
