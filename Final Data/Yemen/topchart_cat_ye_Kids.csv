One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

With the 'Joy Awards' App, it's you who will nominate and vote for your beloved stars and releases in Music, Cinema, Series, Directors, Sports, and Influencers, all for free!



You will nominate and cast your votes in two phases:




First Phase: Nominating Your Favorite Stars and Releases
In the nomination phase, which lasts for one month, you play a crucial role in shaping the competition. 
Here's where YOU come in – choose your favorite nominee from the names or titles listed in each category. If your top pick isn't there, don't worry! You have the chance to add your own favorite name or title, as long as it meets the terms and conditions: it should be a release or achievement from 2025. 
During the nomination phase, you can nominate only once for each category.
This phase eventually leads to the selection of the top four final nominees in each category, representing the stars and releases with the most nominations.
 
Second Phase: Voting for Your Favorite Stars and Releases
After the nominations have been counted, the voting phase begins with the top four nominees in each category, which also spans one month.
Here's where YOU make the difference – cast your votes for your favorite nominees. 
And a month later, the voting counts are gathered, leading to the grand reveal of the winners during the live ""Joy Awards 2026"" ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
During the voting phase, you can vote only once for each category.",2021-10-17T07:00:00Z,2025-11-18T10:53:08Z
