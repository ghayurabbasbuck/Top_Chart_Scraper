What's even more impressive is the introduction of our Heads-Up Display (HUD) mode, effortlessly projecting your speed onto the windshield, enhancing both the joy and convenience of driving.

With our Speedometer GPS Trip Tracker, we offer a variety of trip modes to choose from, whether it's walking, running, biking, driving, or even sailing and flying. You can easily select and start recording your trip in any mode.

This speedometer not only provides real-time and precise speed monitoring but also captures and records comprehensive trip data. From highest speed, average speed, trip distance, and altitude to direction, trip movement and stop time, temperature, and weather information, we save and display it all for you. You can even export this data in GPX format for further analysis and sharing.

Customization is also one of our key features. Depending on the trip mode, you can freely set the dial scale and speed limits on the speedometer. When you exceed the speed limit, the app will alert you in a highly noticeable way, helping you stay within the designated speed.

The map mode allows you to see the real-time trajectory of your current trip, offering both 2D and 3D map views for your selection. You can also choose from a variety of map styles to suit your personal preferences.

But the HUD mode is where we truly elevate your driving experience. By projecting trip information onto your car's windshield, you can effortlessly access trip data without having to divert your attention to your phone. Simply enable the auto-switch to HUD mode in the settings. Please note that before engaging with these features, ensure you have safely parked your vehicle and maintain focus on the road for safety.

Come and experience this groundbreaking Speedometer GPS Trip Tracker, making your trips smarter and more convenient than ever before!
