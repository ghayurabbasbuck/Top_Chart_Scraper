ai,Anguilla,Health & Fitness,6013,12,6469199306,Moodi - CBT & Mood diary,Evgeny Prokopiev,https://apps.apple.com/ai/app/moodi-cbt-mood-diary/id6469199306?uo=4,0.0,0,0,Health & Fitness,"Moodi is simple and effective psychological exercises that can help if you are struggling with anxiety, stress, depression, low self-esteem, and other psychological difficulties. In addition, they improve mood, increase awareness, strengthen mental health, and have an anti-stress effect.
A psychological diary is the best practice for independent work, which has many positive qualities:
- Helps you better understand yourself, your thoughts, feelings, and reactions.
- Allows you to express emotions and experiences, rather than suppressing them, which contributes to better emotional regulation and stress reduction.
- Helps you approach problem-solving and decision-making mindfully.
- Improves personal development and growth.
- Helps you identify sources of stress and anxiety and find ways to cope with them.
- Allows you to better understand yourself and your relationships with people.
Almost every psychologist recommends keeping a personal diary: it can be an emotions diary, a mood journal, a CBT journal, or free-form entries.

What practices do we offer?

Negative situations diary
The Negative Situations diary is a very effective technique for solving psychological problems. The goals of this diary are to help you learn to cope with and experience painful and anxious moments more easily, understand how some events affect your emotions, feelings, and mood, and teach your brain to develop action strategies in similar situations in the future.
It is easy to keep a Negative Situations diary. You need to make entries about every negative moment, track your thoughts, mark emotions, and choose a cognitive distortion. This will allow you to better understand yourself, your behavior, and feelings associated with this event, free your mind from negativity, and feel much better. By changing your approach to solving negative situations, your reaction to them will also change.

Positive moments diary
The Positive Moments diary (Gratitude Journal) is a journal where you note all the positive events, emotions, positivity, and gratitude. It helps you pay attention to the pleasant moments that we often don't notice, as well as reduce stress and other negative factors.
You need to write down all the good and positive moments, thoughts, situations, and mark the emotions you experienced. Write down literally everything: it can be a significant event or something fleeting, the main thing is to pay attention and write down everything that causes positive emotions.

Morning diary
The Morning diary is a technique that helps you set yourself up for the day ahead, free your mind from unnecessary worries, anxious thoughts, and negativity. By practicing, you will notice how motivation and energy rise, creativity, awareness, and self-development develop.
You need to write down your emotions, feelings, experiences, plans, tasks, goals, and even desires every day, immediately after the alarm goes off. In general, everything that seems important to you at that moment.

Evening diary
The evening diary technique involves recording emotions, feelings, and thoughts at the end of the day, right before bed. This allows you to analyze the day, free yourself from stress and tension, helps you let go of worries and worries, relax, which will improve your sleep, help you recover and provide quality rest.
Before bed, write down the events and impressions of the past day, describe in detail your emotions, feelings, and reactions, self-esteem, and physical condition. Write down what lesson you can learn from this day. Don't try to write ""correctly,"" just be honest and write what you think is important.

Do you really know what ingredients your favorite foundation contains? The OnSkin app will set your mind at ease by telling you precisely what you’re putting on your skin and whether it's safe for you.

COSMETIC SAFETY SCANNER
With OnSkin, you have a seasoned digital cosmetologist by your side. Choose from three ways to get a product’s safety profile—take a photo of it, scan its barcode, or look up its name on the app. OnSkin will see past the glitz and glamor and decipher the Latin names on the label in a clear way, flagging any potentially harmful components. Plus, the app recommends cleaner alternatives to help you look and feel healthier inside and out.

SCIENCE IS OUR INFLUENCER
The OnSkin product ratings are 100% unbiased—we don’t partner with any brands. Our in-house team of biologists and physicians have used the latest scientific research on toxicology and dermatology to assess over 15,000 cosmetic ingredients. Using an AI calculating algorithm and human curation, we rate products promptly while preserving the quality of manual analysis.

PERSONALIZED SKINCARE TIPS
Just complete a short survey about your skin to get essential care steps and active ingredients to look for when hunting for new products, all tuned to your unique skin and curated by our skin experts. These may be a great kickoff for starting a substantial skincare routine or double-checking your existing one.

SKIN MATCH
Finding suitable products for your skin (especially if it’s acne-prone and sensitive) can be quite a puzzle, but with OnSkin, you’ll always know if a product is a perfect match, a potential match, or not a match for you. Based on the info you input about your skin type and skincare goals, we check how well a product is tailored to your skin needs, so you can invest in effective formulas without having to experiment with your face.

PRODUCT REVIEWS
Viral products seem tempting to give a shot, but how do you check whether it's all just hype before you rush to Sephora? Every week, you’ll see compilations of the top 10 most buzzy products from various categories, from washes to serums. For each, you’ll learn about the powerful and questionable ingredients and their effects, all explained in simple terms. Plus, our skin experts will weigh in on whether it's good value for money! You get to see the real face of raved-about skincare and pick items based on their effects, not just their popularity.
