You want to know what your flat or house is doing right now - with the MOBILE ALERTS home monitoring system you can easily find out about its condition:

- Are all windows and doors closed?
- Is the freezer cold enough?
- Can I leave the washing machine running unattended?
- Has the power failed?

All these questions will be answered in the future by the MOBILE ALERTS home monitoring system in this practical app in combination with various wireless sensors for your home. All you need to operate this app is the necessary hardware, consisting of the gateway and at least one sensor of your choice (e.g. MOBILE ALERTS Starterkit MA 10001 Set) and an internet connection.

Via the Internet connection and the gateway, the MOBILE ALERTS app enables you to call up all the information from your home on your smartphone anywhere in the world. The sensors permanently monitor the current data and report malfunctions automatically and immediately via push notification to your smartphone, whereby greater damage can be avoided by targeted action. 

The simple installation enables every user to monitor the house at any time in just 5 steps:
Once you have downloaded the permanently free MOBILE ALERTS app from the Appstore, it is immediately ready for use after installation thanks to Plug&Play.
A personal registration is not necessary.
Now connect the gateway to the power supply unit and your router.
Then insert batteries in the selected wireless sensors.
Open the app, scan in the codes of the wireless sensors and you can access all the recorded data with your smartphone and check the current status of your home - anytime, anywhere.
The whole process is completed within 2 minutes at the latest.

The app's self-explanatory, graphical user interface is intuitive to use and can be individually adapted to your needs. Define an individual name for each wireless sensor and set up specific alarm limits yourself. If these alarm limits are exceeded, the wireless sensors immediately report the fault to your smartphone and thus offer you the PLUS in security.

The MOBILE ALERTS system can be expanded with many other wireless sensors as required. In addition to temperature monitoring, these provide additional data on air humidity, water temperature, leaking water, information on open and closed windows or doors and much more.

The MOBILE ALERTS system can be used with many other IoT systems via the Conrad Connect IoT platform. In addition, there is support for the common language assistants.

We are continuously working on the range of our sensors. Further information, an overview of all available sensors and an additional video for installation can be found in your app under INFO or at www.mobile-alerts.eu.",2016-12-22T09:24:38Z,2024-12-11T15:47:21Z

You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:
- pounds per square inch

Custom notifications. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you.
