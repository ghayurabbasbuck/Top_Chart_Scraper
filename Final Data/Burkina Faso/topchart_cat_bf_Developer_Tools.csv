Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee started the web on his NeXT computer.

On that computer was an app named WorldWideWeb. This app was unique because it allowed his machine to edit and serve HTML documents. The app also used coding frameworks that were adopted by Apple after purchasing NeXT: they are being used right now to display what you’re reading.

Like that original app, this WorldWideWeb is a handy web development tool.

It’s designed for people who need to test things on their iPad or iPhone before moving the files onto a real web server like Apache or nginx. It also allows you to work in those increasingly rare moments where you don’t have a connection to the Internet. App developers can use this server to simulate and test APIs that their product uses.

FEATURES

WorldWideWeb does things differently than today’s production web servers:

• Automatic refresh — Watches your site and reloads browser when there are changes
• No caching — Every request gets a new response, no cache busters needed
• Easy to configure — Pick a folder and go
• Directory listings — A handy list of files whenever you hit a URL that doesn’t exist
• Bonjour support – Automatic DNS for easy access using devices on your local network
• REST support — Set default responses as JSON or XML for easy mocking of APIs
• No external dependencies — Completely standalone and doesn’t need other tools like Python or Ruby
• Built-in security — Runs completely in a sandbox, no access to data unless you allow it
• Powerful and lightweight – A small memory footprint with minimal CPU overhead
• No rocket science — Perfect for clients and other folks who are less technically inclined",2022-06-02T07:00:00Z,2025-09-15T16:01:37Z

Juno is designed to cover all your Python coding needs, and will work seamlessly with all source code formats. Juno supports both Python scripts (.py) and Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) — a document format focused on applying Python to data analysis and computational science.

FREE FEATURES

- Navigate and manage files and folders, quickly preview documents and media
- Browse and view Jupyter notebooks with quick and beautifully rendered previews
- View and edit code sources, scripts, JSON, XML, and other text-based formats in a built-in versatile plain text editor with syntax highlighting
- Add quick access bookmarks for file system locations outside the app's sandbox, or simply open documents in place

PRO FEATURES

- Leverage powerful data analysis, machine learning and developer tools: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, LXML, and more
- Enjoy painless package management: easily install any pure Python package with an intuitive package manager

PYTHON SCRIPTS

Python scripts are plain-text Python source code files with a .py extension. Juno lets you work on these with snappy code completion, a console with full terminal emulator support, a built-in media viewer for code-generated images, plots, web apps, and more. Juno will execute the code using an embedded Python interpreter, locally on your iPhone or iPad and completely offline.

JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

A Jupyter notebook is a versatile document format that enables you to store live code, markdown text, plots, images, and LaTeX equations — all within a single notebook file with a .ipynb extension. Notebooks serve as excellent Python coding playgrounds for data manipulation and experimentation, and Juno makes working with them a breeze!

Notebook documents keep a record of all inputs and outputs from an interactive programming session, and the rich output generated by running Python scripts (including HTML, images, video, and plots) is embedded within the Jupyter notebook document. They are particularly convenient for coding in Python for data analysis, machine learning, or computational science in general.",2019-09-26T07:00:00Z,2025-11-16T16:16:35Z
