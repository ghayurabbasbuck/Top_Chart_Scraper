PAYCONIQ is a free App that enables you to pay in stores or online, to pay your bills and to send, receive & request money to and from any phone number, with transfers via the underlying bank account(s) in Luxembourg.
 
- Quick & convenient
- Free (except mobile operator charges)
- From 0.01 € up to 10,000 €
- Highly secure & set your own payment limits
- Send & request money to/from any mobile number - with underlying bank transfer

*** A BANK PAYMENT APP
 
The PAYCONIQ App is linked both to your phone number and your bank account(s). It meets banking-grade security standards; all payments are authorised with your Fingerprint or your PIN Code. You can set your security limits according to your preferences (default: 2500 EUR). Payments are made using (SEPA) bank transfer (funds may only be available the next working day).
 
*** QUICK ACTIVATION
 
To start using the App right away, all you have to do is to link it to your bank account. Launch the App and you’ll be guided through the process, it’s fairly easy.
 
*** SEND, RECEIVE & REQUEST MONEY
 
PAYCONIQ is by far the fastest way to transfer money between two people. Choose the recipient’s phone number from your address book, type in the amount, authorise the payment and a SMS/push message is sent to the recipient. If the recipient has already activated PAYCONIQ, the operation is triggered immediately, and if not, a SMS message is sent out inviting the recipient to subscribe. Once he/she has activated PAYCONIQ, funds will be transferred into the recipient’s bank account.
 
Request money from any phone number: the most convenient way to get paid back by your friends, family or colleagues. Simply choose their phone number, type in the amount and they’ll get the request. You’ll receive a notification once they have made the requested payment.
 
*** IN STORE PAYMENT 
 
Truly contactless payments: launch the PAYCONIQ App, ,scan the  PAYCONIQ QR code, the amount to pay is automatically displayed on your phone. Validate the payment with your fingerprint/PIN Code and you’re done.
 
*** BILL PAYMENT WITH QR CODES
 
The quickest way to pay the bills: launch the App, scan the PAYCONIQ QR Code on the bill, confirm the payment and you’re done, typically in less than 10 seconds. It works with your insurance and energy bills, with your telecom and public sector/municipality invoices provided PAYCONIQ payments are accepted.
 
Feel free to use it at PAYCONIQ partner restaurants as well: no need to wait for the payment terminal, just scan the QR Code on the bill. 
 
*** PAYMENT IN OTHER APPS & IN ONLINE STORES
 
Top up your kid’s Restopolis account or use PAYCONIQ on selected web sites: it is the most secure and the most convenient way to pay by clicking on the PAYCONIQ button in the App/web site or in the web store. No card or bank data is transferred and nobody else can use your PAYCONIQ App as all payments are authorised via fingerprint/PIN Code.",2013-07-21T07:00:00Z,2023-09-28T08:34:12Z
