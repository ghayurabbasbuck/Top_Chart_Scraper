Control and manage your smart appliances anytime, anywhere

Did I switch off the oven? Instead of heading back home to check, simply take a look at the app. You will see and be able to control the status of your appliances straight away with immediate access to important functionalities, whether at home or on the go.

Be aware of all that’s important

Oh, the fridge door has been left open? When do I need to descale the coffee machine? How often should I clean the oven? Important notifications and reminders regarding maintenance and care will be sent to you automatically. And even if things don’t go to plan: by using remote diagnostics our customer service team will help you resolve any issue. You can also simply check the manual which is conveniently stored in the app.

Voice-control your appliances via Amazon Alexa, or Google Home

Whether it’s making coffee, preheating the oven, or starting the washing machine: Voice your command and Amazon Alexa or Google Home will take care of the rest. What’s more, you can use predefined or individual routines for recurring tasks to orchestrate your smart home, like having your coffee made at the same time each working day.

Finding the best programme and other little helpers

Dishwasher, dryer, or oven – depending on the appliance and task at hand, you will be recommended the ideal programme and settings, whether it’s a pile of dirty dishes, a load of washing, or the cheesecake recipe for your next family reunion. Based on your feedback, programmes can even improve over time to better fit your needs. And with Coffee Playlist you can conveniently fulfil your guests’ coffee requests to match that cheesecake.

Let your oven do the work

Don’t want to keep checking whether your dish is ready? Simply set the desired browning level for the selected dish and start the oven. Artificial Intelligence evaluates the browning level based on images taken by the integrated camera. The oven switches off as soon as the selected level is reached. The camera also lets you check your dish from anywhere on your smartphone.
