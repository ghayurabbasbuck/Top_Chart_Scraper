The Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD) is an official tool destined at documenting the Luxembourgish language. Its origins go back to 29 July 1999 and the Règlement grand-ducal portant création du Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise.
 
The LOD is considered an orthographic reference conveying the meaning of common Luxembourgish expressions by means of translation elements in four different languages: German, French, English and Portuguese. The LOD can also be used as a writing assistance or translation tool.

Alongside translations, the following information can be found in the LOD: example sentences, proverbs and figures of speech with an explanation, synonyms, information regarding pronunciation (audio file and IPA-transcription), sign language videos.

So-called info boxes include orthographic, grammatical or historical information that would be out of place in the more rigid frame of the dictionary entries.

An error-tolerant search enables the user to look up content in the five LOD languages in an easy and intuitive manner. An advanced search also makes it possible to call up lists of Luxembourgish expressions by respecting certain criteria (wild card character, part of speech, phonetics, language register, ...)

Additionally, the expressions are subdivided into categories: job descriptions, animals, insults, vehicles, fruit and vegetables, ...

The Zenter fir d’Lëtzebuerger Sprooch – Centre for the Luxembourgish language (http://zls.lu) was created with the law of 20 July 2018 on the promotion of the Luxembourgish language and is in charge of the maintenance and development of the LOD.

Den LOD fir ënnerwee – déi offiziell App vum Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire
 
D’Originne vum Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD), engem offiziellen Tool fir d'Dokumentatioun vun der Lëtzebuerger Sprooch, ginn zeréck op de Règlement grand-ducal vum 29. Juli 1999 portant création du Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise.
 
Den LOD gëllt als orthografesch Referenz a vermëttelt de Sënn vun de gängege lëtzebuergesche Wierder unhand vun eendeitegen Iwwersetzungselementer a véier Sproochen: Däitsch, Franséisch, Englesch a Portugisesch.
Den Dictionnaire kann awer och als Schreif- an/oder als Iwwersetzungshëllef gebraucht ginn.
 
Niewent den Iwwersetzunge stinn ënner anerem och nach dës Informatiounen am LOD: Beispillssätz, Spréchwierder a Riedewendunge mat enger Erklärung, Synonymmen, Informatiounen iwwer d’Aussprooch (Audio-Datei an IPA-Transkriptioun), Gebäerdevideoen.
 
A sougenannten Infoboxe sti wichteg orthografesch, grammatesch oder historesch Informatiounen, déi net an de rigide Kader vun den Dictionnaires-Artikele passen.
 
Iwwer eng feelertolerant Sich ka ganz einfach an intuitiv an de fënnef LOD-Sproochen no Inhalter gesicht ginn. Eng erweidert Sich erlaabt et awer och, fir sech Lëschte mat lëtzebuergesche Wierder uweisen ze loossen, déi verschiddene Krittären (Jokerzeechen, Wuertaart, Phoneetik, Sproochregëster, ...) entspriechen.
 
Ausserdeem sinn d’Wierder a Kategorien ënnerdeelt: Beruffsbezeechnungen, Déieren, Frechheeten, Gefierer, Uebst & Geméis, ...
 
Den Zenter fir d'Lëtzebuerger Sprooch (http://zls.lu), deen duerch d'Gesetz vum 20. Juli 2018 iwwer d’Promotioun vun der Lëtzebuerger Sprooch geschafe gouf, këmmert sech ëm d'Maintenance an ëm d'Entwécklung vum LOD.",2022-11-23T08:00:00Z,2023-12-06T16:37:01Z

Our advanced technology generates a stunning photo of your ancestors and reveals your true origin story. See who you really are. All from just one selfie.

Forget boring family trees that end in names on a chart. We offer a tangible connection. Our technology renders a lifelike, era-authentic portrait of ancestors you’ve never met, capturing a plausible likeness with a strangely familiar face. It’s a jaw-dropping, shareable moment of connection when you see your own eyes, your smile, looking back at you from another time. This is the family photograph that was never taken.

But the portrait is just the beginning. It’s your entry point into a complete Ancestral Report, a deep dive into the elements that define your heritage.

First, discover your true origins with a detailed, percentage-based breakdown of your nationality. Go beyond continents to see the specific blend of cultures that make up your unique identity, revealing connections you never knew existed. Then, we reveal their story. Learn about the specific city your ancestors likely called home, the authentic craft they dedicated their lives to, and even the historical diet that fueled their world.

Your origin story doesn't just end in the past—it echoes in your present. The resilience of a frontiersman, the precision of an artisan, the creativity of a storyteller; these are more than historical facts, they are potential traits within you. We connect your heritage to your life today, offering unique insights for modern careers and lifestyles that may align with these ancestral strengths. It’s a powerful new way to understand your own passions and potential.

Join a growing community of people discovering themselves in a completely new way. The stories and portraits generated by EDNA are sparking conversations, connecting families, and helping people see their own identity in a richer, deeper light. It's a unique experience everyone is talking about.

This isn’t a guess. Our analysis is powered by a vast database of real historical records, cultural trends, and geographic data. This robust framework allows us to create a narrative that feels both magical and deeply plausible. We are committed to your privacy; your photo and personal data are always secure and are never shared.

To analyze your photos and create your unique ancestral story, you’ll need a True Heritage Pro subscription. The Pro subscription allows you to unlock full access to detailed reports, including Explore Your Ancestors, Explore Your Origins, Your Ideal Partner, and Your Past Life.
