Yuka is a free mobile app that allows you to scan the barcodes of food and personal care products and instantly see their impact on your health. A rating and detailed information help you understand the analysis of each product.

When a product has a negative impact on your health, Yuka also recommends similar but healthier alternative products.

After a huge success in France, Belgium and Spain, Yuka decided to launch the UK after receiving many requests across the Channel. 

◆ A 100% INDEPENDENT PROJECT ◆

Yuka is a 100% independent project : product reviews and recommendations of healthier alternatives are done in an objective way. No brand or manufacturer can influence them in one way or another. Furthermore, there is no in-app advertising. You can access detailed information on our business model on our website (www.yuka.io).

◆ 5 MILLION REFERENCED PRODUCTS ◆

Yuka established a database that contains 3 million food products and 2 million cosmetic products.

Each food product is evaluated according to 3 objective criteria: nutritional quality, presence of additives and organic aspect of the product.

The method to analyse cosmetic products is based on the analysis of all the ingredients of the product. Each ingredient is assigned a risk level according to the latest scientific data.

Studies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. 

At Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.

Brush for a Clean that Wows
3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. 

Assess Your Brushing Habits
Pull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. 

Get Personalized Coaching
Receive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. 

Access Personalized Insights at a Glance
Browse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. 

Track Your Gum Bleeding
The unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.
 
Revolutionize Your Oral Health
Statistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. 
•	Over 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure
•	Over 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]

You can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!

Using our mobile app in conjunction with one of our body composition analyzers or blood pressure monitors, users can directly measure muscle, fat, water, and blood pressure to see how these values, when combined with activity levels and nutritional habits, create a snapshot of whole body health. By regularly reviewing this information, individuals will be able to track progress over time and use this progress as momentum for continued, healthy improvement.
Use the InBody App to:
● Evaluate key summaries of recent InBody Tests, active minutes, and nutritional information from the new overview dashboard
● View historic data for body composition in up to one month increments
● Review accurate body composition testing results, graphs, and interpretations
● Monitor blood pressure levels by comparing test results over time
● Manage caloric outputs and monitor daily movement, such as step counts and active minutes, through our training log. Use values to see how they correlate with changes in body composition over time
● Record daily exercise and food intake using our digital tracking log
● See your national ranking and start healthy competitions with friends and family, based on your InBody Score and weekly step count
● Track sleep time by syncing the InBody BAND 2 with the app
