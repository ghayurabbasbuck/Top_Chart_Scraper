The Ministry of Sport, ENEPS, COSL, the Sportlycée and the LIHPS have come together to take on this complex task. The result of this intensive process is a collectively defined joint strategy that covers sports policy, federations, clubs and coaches, as well as athletes and their environment, based on the LTAD framework. 
This knowledge app was developed primarily for coaches, educators and teaching staff, regardless of whether they are involved at federation level, in a club, in a commune, in education and care services for children, or otherwise. It uses instructional materials to provide quick and easy tutorials that suit the user’s age, personal goals or ability level. 
National and international experts from a wide range of sports and fields of specialisation impart their skills and expertise, each bringing knowledge from their own sporting disciplines and interdisciplinary expertise together on one digital platform. The sport and physical activity sector in Luxembourg, therefore, has the perfect opportunity to improve its network, expand its expertise and exchange both experience and knowledge thanks to this app. Indeed, LTAD – Lëtzebuerg lieft Sport allows to consider athletes’ individual development phases, their age-specific requirements and their personal goals, thus creating a holistic source of interdisciplinary expertise, drawn from a wide variety of sports, based on a training philosophy. Areas such as strength, endurance and speed training, as well as fundamental motor skills, technique, strategy and tactics are covered, primarily in the form of videos. 
In the near future, however, the app also has the potential to expand its reach even further and to become a means of help and support for sport and physical activity throughout Luxembourg. This will allow parents, referees, sports officials and the athletes themselves to draw both inspiration and information about current training and further education in the sport and physical activity sector. 
In the spirit of today’s sharing mentality, everybody involved in sport in the Grand Duchy should be able to benefit from the contributing experts’ knowledge.",2021-01-27T08:00:00Z,2024-11-26T16:10:29Z
