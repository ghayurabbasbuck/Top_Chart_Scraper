Be aware of all that’s important

Oh, the fridge door has been left open? When do I need to descale the coffee machine? How often should I clean the oven?

Dishwasher, dryer, or oven – depending on the appliance and task at hand, you will be recommended the ideal programme and settings, whether it’s a pile of dirty dishes, a load of washing, or the cheesecake recipe for your next family reunion. Based on your feedback, programmes can even improve over time to better fit your needs. And with Coffee Playlist you can conveniently fulfil your guests’ coffee requests to match that cheesecake.

Let your oven do the work

Don’t want to keep checking whether your dish is ready? Simply set the desired browning level for the selected dish and start the oven. Artificial Intelligence evaluates the browning level based on images taken by the integrated camera. The oven switches off as soon as the selected level is reached. The camera also lets you check your dish from anywhere on your smartphone.

BUILD YOUR OWN SECURITY AND COMFORT SYSTEM WITH AJAX DEVICES


INTRUSION PROTECTION
The detectors instantly capture an intruder on your property, doors or windows opening, and glass breaking. As soon as a person enters a protected area, they will be captured by a detector from the MotionCam series, an Ajax camera, or a third-party camera. You and the security company will know what happened at the facility within just a few seconds.

VIDEO SURVEILLANCE IN THE SMARTPHONE 
Ajax cameras, powered by proprietary video streaming technology, offer an integrated and efficient surveillance solution. Synchronized with system events, they grant users access to video data and enable customizable scenario-based recordings.
The video wall provides real-time views across large areas or multiple sites without system overload. 

ONE CLICK, AND HELP IS ON THE WAY
In case of an emergency, press the panic button on the app to immediately transmit the event and smartphone coordinates to the security company. 

FIRE DETECTION
Fire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spikes and promptly alert about dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, which have no color, smell, or taste. Configure programmable actions for ManualCallPoint to open electric locks, cut power to devices, and activate ventilation with a simple press.

FLOOD PREVENTION
LeaksProtect Jeweller notifies users of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. WaterStop Jeweller automatically shuts off the water if LeaksProtect Jeweller or a third-party water leak detector is triggered. Control WaterStop Jeweller and check its status from anywhere in the world via the Ajax app. Create a scenario to shut off the water at a specific time or when arming the system.

AUTOMATION SCENARIOS
Change security modes according to a schedule, program outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system. Manage gates, electric locks, lighting, heating, and electrical appliances. Activate ventilation, simulate home activity, or switch off potential ignition sources.

PROFESSIONAL LEVEL OF RELIABILITY
The hub runs on OS Malevich, which is protected from failures, viruses, and cyberattacks. Thanks to the backup battery and communication channels, the system is resistant to power outages or the lack of Internet connectivity. The account is protected by session control and two-factor authentication. Ajax devices were tested for compliance with various requirements, rules, and regulations and have been rated as Grade 2 and Grade 3.
