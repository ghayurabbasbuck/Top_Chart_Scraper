We see Women’s sexual wellness as important as general wellbeing. In our eyes, sexual selfcare is a topic that is not yet talked about enough.

Erotica was created for Women and Couples and is also LBGTQ friendly. More than 80% of listeners say that Erotica had a positive effect on their sexual wellness. The best part is that the stories leave you hands-free! Just press play, get comfortable and enjoy.

What is Erotica great for:
