Along with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.

Through our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.

**The I Am Sober app features:**

• Sober day tracker
To visualize how long you’ve been sober.

• Remember why you quit
Add reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.

• Daily pledge tracker
Take a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.

• Sobriety calculator
View how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.

• Analyze triggers
Recap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.

• Share your story
Either with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.

• Milestone tracker
Track and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.

• Withdrawal timeline
When you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.

• Customize your experience
You set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.

**Sober Plus subscriptions**

I Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:

• Create a group
Stay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.

• Locked access
Keep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.

• Data Backups
Save your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.

• More tracking
Track more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.

Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.
