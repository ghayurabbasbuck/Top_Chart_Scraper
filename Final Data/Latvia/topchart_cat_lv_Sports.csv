As well as using QR barcodes to load the course, start, finish and read checkpoints, you can now use your device's GPS to detect your location.

iOrienteering allows both score and point to point (linear) courses. Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created

You can set up private or public course. 

Private if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.

Simple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. 

For a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. 

If you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it.",2013-06-25T02:32:02Z,2025-09-02T14:21:10Z
