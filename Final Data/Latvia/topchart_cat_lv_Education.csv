* IZGLĪTOJOŠS SATURS

Spēles tiek izstrādātas sadarbībā ar skolotājiem un izglītības ekspertiem.
 
* VECUMAM ATBILSTOŠS
Lai nodrošinātu satura atbilstību bērna attīstības līmenim, spēles ir sadalītas četrās grūtības pakāpēs. Precīzs vecuma ierobežojums nav norādīts, jo bērnu prasmes un intereses atšķiras.
 
* PERSONISKS  
ALPA spēlēs visi ir uzvarētāji, jo katrs bērns iepriecinošos balonus iegūst savā tempā un savām prasmēm atbilstošā līmenī.
 
* NOVIRZĪŠANA UZ DARBĪBĀM ĀRPUS EKRĀNA
Spēles ir savstarpēji saistītas ar ārpus ekrāna aktivitātēm, lai bērns jau agrīni pierastu pie pārtraukumiem starp nodarbēm pie ekrāna. Tāpat nāk par labu atkārtot to, kas tikko apgūts un sasaistīt to ar reālo dzīvi. Turklāt ALPA bērnus izglītojošo spēļu starplaikos aicina uz kopīgu deju! 

* MĀCĪBU ANALĪTIKA 
Varat bērnam izveidot profilu un turpmāk sekot līdzi statistikai, kā bērns attīstās, kas viņam padodas un kur nepieciešama palīdzība.  
 
* AR VIEDĀM FUNKCIJĀM
 
Lietošana bez interneta:
Lietotne ir pieejama arī bez interneta, lai mazinātu risku bērnam apmaldīties interneta pasaulē.

Ieteikumu sistēma:
Lietotne, pamatojoties uz anonīmiem lietošanas modeļiem, izdara secinājumus par bērna prasmēm un, balstoties uz šiem secinājumiem, iesaka piemērotākās spēles. 
 
Runas palēninātājs:
Alpa, izmantojot automātisku runas palēninātāju, var runāt arī lēnāk. Šī funkcija ir īpaši populāra bērniem, kuri runā citās valodās! 
 
Laika uzņemšana:
Bērnam nepieciešama papildu motivācija? Tādā gadījumā viņam varētu būt piemērota laika uzņemšanas funkcija, kas ļaus atkal un atkal lauzt savus rekordus.
 
* DROŠS
ALPA lietotne neapkopo personisko informāciju par jūsu ģimeni un neveic datu pārdošanu. Turklāt lietotnē nav reklāmu, jo mēs to neuzskatām par ētisku.
 
* SATURS ARVIEN PAPILDINĀS
ALPA lietotnē jau ir vairāk nekā 60 spēles par alfabētu, skaitļiem, putniem un dzīvniekiem, un mēs izstrādājam arvien jaunas un jaunas spēles.  
 
Par maksas pasūtījumu:
 
* GODĪGA CENAS IZVEIDE
Kā mēdz teikt “ja tu par produktu nemaksā, tad par produktu tu kļūsti pats”. Taisnība, ka daudzas mobilās lietotnes ir it kā bezmaksas, bet patiesībā tās nopelna par reklāmu un datu pārdošanu. Mēs tomēr dodam priekšroku godīgai cenas izveidei.
 
* DAUDZ VAIRĀK SATURA
Ar maksas pasūtījumu lietotnē ir ievērojami vairāk satura. Simtiem jaunu zināšanu! 
 
* IETVER JAUNAS SPĒLES
Cenā ir iekļautas arī jaunas papildu spēles. Sekojiet līdzi, lai uzzinātu, ko jaunu un aizraujošu mēs izstrādājam!
 
* PIEŠĶIR MĀCĪŠANĀS MOTIVĀCIJU
Maksas pasūtījuma gadījumā var izmantot laika uzņemšanas funkciju, t.i., bērns var lauzt savus rekordus un uzturēt mācīšanās motivāciju.
 
* ĒRTI
Ar maksas pasūtījumu izvairīsieties no kaitinošiem daudzkārtējiem maksājumiem, kā tas ir, piemēram, pērkot atsevišķas spēles. 
 
* ATBALSTĪSIET LATVIEŠU VALODU
Atbalstīsiet jaunu spēļu izstrādi latviešu valodā un caur to arī latviešu valodas saglabāšanu.
 
* ĻOTI IZDEVĪGI


Gada abonements ir 6.99 EUR, kas sastāda tikai 0.6 EUR mēnesī. Tas taču ir mazāk nekā tase kafijas!

Ieteikumi un jautājumi vienmēr ir laipni gaidīti!
