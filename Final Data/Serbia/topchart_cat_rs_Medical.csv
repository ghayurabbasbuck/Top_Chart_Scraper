If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.

Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.
This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.
If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.
