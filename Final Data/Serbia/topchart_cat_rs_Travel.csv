HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Who is Airalo best for?

- Digital nomads who need to stay connected to work while abroad.
- Crew members (e.g., seafarers, flight attendants, etc.) who need to stay connected while they travel.
- Anyone who wants an easy and affordable data alternative to their home network.

Can I use my SIM card at the same time?
Yes! Most devices allow you to use multiple SIMs and/or eSIMs simultaneously. You can keep your primary line active to receive text messages, calls, and 2FA authentication (but remember, they'll be subject to roaming fees).


Happy travels!
