Trenutno imamo najviše radio stanica iz Srbije, a broj radio stanica svakog dana raste.

Narodna muzika, zabavna muzika ili rok muzika izbor je Vaš!

Aplikacija ne radi bez interneta, a sve radio stanice rade 24h uživo! Slušajte srpski radio bilo kada i bilo gde preko svog telefona.

Popularne Srpske radio stanice na vašem mobilnom telefonu možete da pretražujte po žanrovima ili po gradovima. Lista radio stanica se formira prema slušanosti u aplikaciji. Kada izaberite vašu omiljenu radio stanicu pustite je, a aplikacija će ostati u pozadini dok Vi radite bilo šta drugo na vašem telefonu.

Opcija ""Omiljene"" Vam omogućava da napravite vašu listu omiljenih FM radio stanica i slušate besplatnu muziku kada god poželite.

Opcija ""Nedavno"" Vam izlistava poslednjih 50 slušanih FM radio stanica tako da se uvek možete vratiti i videti šta ste slušali prethodno.

Srpska muzika po žanrovima:
Narodna muzika, Zabavna muzika, Srpska muzika, muzika uzivo, Rok, Haus, Dens, Tehno muzika, Lagana, Hip-hop, Rep Disco Mix, Romska muzika, Evergrin, Vlaška muzika, Krajiška, Izvorna muzika, Klasična, Starogradska muzika, Kola, Dečija muzika, Exyu, Duhovna, Bluz, Džez ...

Napomena:
Da bi se besplatna muzika slušala uzivo, aplikacija ""Radio Uživo Srbija"" zahteva stalnu internet konekciju za slušanje internet radio stanica. Zato je potrebno da imate pristup internetu kako bi je koristili.

Nešto nije do nas:
- Neke radio stanice imaju limite za maksimalni broj slušalaca, pa će delovati kao da ne rade, molimo Vas pokušajte ponovo za nekoliko minuta.
- Neke radio stanice nemaju listu pesama uživo pa je ni mi ne možemo prikazati.

Hvala vam što slušate internet radio stanice iz Srbije i koristite aplikaciju Radio Uživo Srbija.
