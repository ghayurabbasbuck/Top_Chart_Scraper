You can also specify the patrol type, choosing from options like radar, alcotest, etc. Stay informed with real-time notifications about patrols reported by fellow users, and contribute by confirming or negating reported patrols based on your own observations.

When you click on a patrol, detailed information is revealed, including who posted it and when, as well as its probability and comments. Your every vote is recorded, and if you provide truthful information, your reliability increases, or decreases if you provide misleading information. Through a sophisticated algorithm, user reliability and patrol probability are calculated to ensure the most accurate information is presented to all users. Patrols are displayed on the map in red, orange, and yellow, with an icon representing the patrol type, indicating the probability of them being at the marked location. Additionally, potential patrols marked in grey represent patrols that have often been found in the same locations in the past.

Furthermore, MyPatrol offers additional options centered around the core functionality of reporting patrols. These include navigation with the option to avoid patrols, as well as suggesting, confirming, or denying the locations of speed cameras, red light cameras, and general cameras, and reporting events such as road closures, crashes, slowdowns, or construction. Become part of the community by engaging with users via live chat and competing on the leaderboard. Explore ways to tailor the app to suit your preferences, like adjusting the map options and alerts, changing the app theme, and so much more.

Note: The app serves as a platform for sharing information between drivers. We urge for cautious driving and adherence to traffic rules to ensure everyone's safety on the road.
MyPatrol currently covers only the Southeast European market, so receiving a verification code during registration is possible only for users from these countries.

It helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.

No surprises on the road
Get detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. 
It also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.

Get multi-stop directions
There’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.
Plan a route with 4-10 stops and tap ""Optimize."" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.

Get your bearings anywhere 
No matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.

Never get lost offline
Find places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.

Pay for parking 
Look for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.

Pay for fuel
Choose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.

Steer clear of poor road conditions
Turn on ""Avoid bad and unpaved roads"" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.

Plan your trips ahead of time
Adjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.
For example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.

Get directions tailored to your vehicle
If you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select ""Add truck"" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.

Monitor traffic in real time
Yandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.

See your route laid out in front of you 
Yandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.

The app works in Russia, Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.
