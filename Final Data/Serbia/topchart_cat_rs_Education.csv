“You actually learn fun math facts and fill gaps when you compulsively reach for your phone. Useful app!” — KellyR.

“Hands-on app to improve your financial literacy, the lessons are practical and fun!” — AlvesT.

“Nibble is top-notch to learn on the go! I like the probability lesson, it’s really practical and easy to follow.” — Isikatony

""The lessons are quick, fun (the Egyptian section with the tweets between the gods made me and my 12-year-old chuckle), clever - and genuinely interesting. My kid and I will go through lessons together - it’s interesting enough to keep his attention, and I’m learning new things too. Not too advanced for him, or remedial for me. I’ve enjoyed all the lessons - logic (the infinite hotel theory was great), art, math, and history. It is indeed much more enjoyable than doom scrolling. I encourage you to take a chance, I’m hooked. Please keep the new lessons coming!"" — BustedKate
