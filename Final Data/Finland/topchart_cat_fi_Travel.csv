Kaikki lomaasi koskevat tiedot on kerätty samaan paikkaan – mobiililaitteessa käytettävään TUI-sovellukseen. Sovelluksen kautta voit olla yhteydessä TUIn oppaisiin vuorokauden ympäri sekä ennen lomaa että sen aikana. Sovelluksesta näet myös lentosi ja lentokenttäkuljetuksesi tiedot ja saat vinkkejä siitä, mitä voit lomakohteessa tehdä. Voit valita lukuisista kiinnostavista retkistä ja aktiviteeteista sekä lennoista ja hotelleista – ja tehdä varaukset suoraan matkasovelluksessa.

Tässä muutamia esimerkkejä sovelluksen toiminnoista:

- Ota yhteyttä oppaisiin vuorokauden ympäri – sekä ennen matkaa että sen aikana
- Valitse aktiviteeteista ja elämyksistä mieleisesi, ja varaa helposti sovelluksessa
- Katso lentoaikataulut ja varaamasi lentokenttäkuljetuksen tiedot
- Tarkista lennon lähtöportti ja matkalaukkuhihna
- Seuraa loman lähtölaskentaa ja lomakohteen säätietoja
- Vastaanota vinkkejä lomakohteesta loman suunnittelua varten
- Lue hotellitiedot, katso viikko-ohjelma ja varaa aktiviteetteja
- Tarkista tehtävä- ja pakkauslistalta ennen matkaa hoidettavat asiat
- Tee lähtöselvitys TUIn lennoille
- Tilaa tax-free-ostokset ja varaa lisäpalveluita 
- Etsi loma laajasta matka-, lento ja hotellivalikoimasta, varaa matka ja maksa sovelluksen kautta 

Ota yhteyttä TUI-oppaisiin ympäri vuorokauden
TUI-sovelluksen kautta voit olla yhteydessä oppaisiin ympäri vuorokauden, kaikkina viikon päivinä. Lähetät kysymyksesi sovelluksen Kysy oppailta -osiossa ja saat vastauksen nopeasti. Ja oppaat tavoitat sovelluksen kautta jo suunnitteluvaiheessa – matkan varaamista seuraavasta päivästä alkaen. Sovellukseen saat myös viestejä, niin hyviä lomavinkkejä kuin tietoja tärkeistä asioista matkan aikana. 

Varaa TUIn aktiviteetteja ja elämyksiä
Koe lomallasi enemmän, osallistumalla lomakohteessa tehtäviin aktiviteetteihin ja retkiin. Valitse lukuisien elämysten joukosta omasi ja tee varaus suoraan sovelluksessa. Sieltä tarkistat myös tarkat noutoajat ja -paikat. 

Lentokenttäkuljetuksen tiedot
Jos olet varannut bussikuljetuksen, näet sovelluksesta bussin numeron ja noutopaikan. Kotiinpaluun lähestyessä saat myös viestillä tiedot lentokenttäkuljetuksen noutoajasta ja -paikasta. 

Inspiraatiota ja lomasuunnittelua
Sovelluksessa voit seurata lomasi lähtölaskentaa. Voit myös seurata lomakohteesi sääennusteita. Lisäksi löydät tietoja lomakohteesi nähtävyyksistä, rannoista, ostoksista ja ravintoloista. 

Varaa lisäpalveluita
Lomasovelluksemme kautta voit tehdä tax-free-ostoksia sekä varata istumapaikan, lisää jalkatilaa tai matkatavarapainoa. (Koskee vain tiettyjä lentoja).

Etsi ja varaa matka
TUIn matkavalikoimassamme on satoja matkakohteita ympäri maailman – Thaimaan ja Kanariansaarten rannoista suurkaupunkeihin, kuten Rooma ja Barcelona. Voit varata matkapaketteja, lentoja, hotelleja, retkiä, aktiviteetteja ja lippuja suoraan TUI-sovelluksen kautta. 

Lisää varauksesi sovellukseen
Kun olet varannut matkan, voit helposti lisätä varauksesi sovellukseen. Syötät vain varausnumerosi sekä matkavarauksellesi antamasi puhelinnumeron tai sähköpostiosoitteen sovelluksessa. 

TUI-sovelluksen käyttö on mahdollista useimmilla lomillamme, mutta joillain lomatyypeillä sovelluksen käyttö ei ole mahdollista, tämä koskee pelkkiä yhdensuuntaisia lentoja ja risteilyjä. Jos olet varannut pelkän hotellin, voit lisätä varauksesi sovellukseen ja nähdä hotellisi tiedot, mutta muut sovelluksen toiminnot eivät toistaiseksi ole käytettävissä.",2016-05-17T08:45:21Z,2025-11-08T04:38:03Z
