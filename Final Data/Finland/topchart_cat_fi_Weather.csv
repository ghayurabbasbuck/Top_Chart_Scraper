Ruuvi Station collects and visualises Ruuvi sensor data, such as temperature, relative air humidity, air pressure and movement from local Bluetooth Ruuvi sensors and Ruuvi Cloud. Additionally, Ruuvi Station allows you to manage your Ruuvi devices, set alerts, change background photos, and visualise the gathered sensor information through graphs. 


How does it work?

Ruuvi sensors send tiny messages over Bluetooth, which can then be picked up by nearby mobile phones or specialised Ruuvi Gateway routers. Ruuvi Station mobile app enables you to collect and visualise this data on your mobile device. Ruuvi Gateway, on the other hand, routes the data over the internet not only to the mobile application but also to the browser application.

Ruuvi Gateway routes the sensor measurement data directly to the Ruuvi Cloud cloud service, which enables you to build a complete remote monitoring solution including remote alerts, sensor sharing and history in Ruuvi Cloud – all available within the Ruuvi Station app! Ruuvi Cloud users can view longer measurement history by using the browser application.

Use our customisable Ruuvi mobile widgets alongside the Ruuvi Station app when data is fetched from Ruuvi Cloud to view selected sensor data at a glance. 

Above features are available to you if you are a Ruuvi Gateway owner or have received a shared sensor to your free Ruuvi Cloud account.

To use the app, get Ruuvi sensors from our official website: ruuvi.com",2019-02-14T10:55:29Z,2025-11-11T05:56:58Z

What people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:

- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.
by jefffafa123

- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!
by AndyLPhoto

- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!
by AwesomeV01

- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.
