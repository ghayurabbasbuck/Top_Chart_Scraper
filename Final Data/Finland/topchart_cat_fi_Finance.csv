See if we can lower the interest on your installments, credit card debt, and personal loans. When you move them to us, you can always choose to pay off at a faster pace.

- Collect all your loans in one place and get an overview of your repayments.
- Set your own repayment plan.
- Make extra payments whenever it suits you.

Pay less interest, pay off more.
When less money goes to interest, more goes to paying off the debt itself. The faster you pay off, the cheaper the total cost of the loan becomes.

Keep track of your subscriptions.

Are you paying for things you don’t use? See all your subscriptions, recurring payments, and fixed costs in one place. Cancel unused subscriptions directly in the app with just a click or two. Maybe you’ll find money you can use to make extra payments on your loan instead.

See your UC credit score directly in the Anyfin app.
Together with UC, we’ve developed UC-Kollen, where you can check your credit score directly in our app. It’s completely free and does not affect your credit score.

Insure the monthly cost of your loan.
Anyfin’s Payment Protection Insurance can help you cover your essential monthly costs if you become sick or are involuntarily unemployed. You choose the monthly amount you want to insure (up to 10,000 SEK per month).

Important! Borrowing costs money.
If you cannot repay your debt on time, you risk getting a payment default. This can lead to difficulties in renting a home, signing contracts, and obtaining new loans. For support, contact budget and debt counseling in your municipality. Contact details can be found on konsumentverket.se.

Representative example

A refinancing loan of 45 000 SEK at 14,16% nominal interest rate with a repayment period of 60 months, with 60 installments of 1 051 SEK, results in a total effective interest rate of 15,12%. The total repayment amount will be 63 048 SEK.

The maximum amount that can be refinanced with Anyfin is 500 000 SEK. The loan term can be as short as 1 month and as long as 180 months, depending on the current term. The nominal interest rate can range from a minimum of 6,98 % to a maximum of 23,00 %. The effective interest rate can range from a minimum of 7,21 % to a maximum of 25,59 %.",2019-10-03T07:00:00Z,2025-10-29T10:14:58Z
