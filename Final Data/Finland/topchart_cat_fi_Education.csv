WordDive is a Finnish language-learning app that’ll help you learn real-life language skills quickly. The learning process is based on WordDive's patented multisensory and individually paced learning method. All learning material is created by Finnish language teachers and proofread and recorded by native speakers. 

• Choose a language: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Russian, Swedish, Finnish or Estonian.
• Learn the most common vocabulary and essential grammar permanently.
• The material is created by Finnish language teachers.
• The language courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
• You can practice on several different devices: the results are saved automatically.

Start today and break the language barrier!

How does WordDive work?

With WordDive, you’ll learn by reading, writing, listening and speaking. The learning algorithm optimises the pace of the exercises individually so that the study items are transferred from working memory to long-term memory. This is what we call permanent learning.

Permanent learning means that you’ll learn vocabulary and the most important grammar topics by heart. It requires you to write what you’re learning correctly, without listening, on at least two separate days. Once you’ve learned the basics of the language permanently, your confidence in using it increases and your language skills start improving rapidly. 

The learning material is divided into skill levels and courses of approximately 40–60 study items. Following the clear and ready-made learning path is easy. You don’t have to worry about planning your studies – you can just enjoy learning. 

By real life language skills, we mean understanding the language you’re studying and being able to have spontaneous conversations with native speakers. With WordDive, you’ll reach a sufficient level of proficiency and learn things you need on the road, at work and in other practical situations!

Who is WordDive for?

WordDive is great for motivated adults who have full calendars and can’t always get to a specific classroom at a specific time. Everyone can choose a starting level that suits them and practice anywhere. 

Whether you want to learn the basics of Spanish for your holiday or hone your English skills for work, WordDive is the right choice. 

Why do I need to pay for WordDive?

• All learning material is created by Finnish language teachers and proofread and recorded by native speakers.
• No ads will distract you from learning.
• Our maintenance and customer service are there for you every day of the year.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.

Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.

Students can keep track of what's due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks from within Classroom.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has handed in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.

There are many benefits of using Classroom:

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time
The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.

Improves organisation
Students can see all of their assignments on an Assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.

Enhances communication
Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.

Secure
Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, and never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.

Permissions notice:
Camera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.
Microphone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.
Photos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",2015-01-13T08:00:00Z,2025-11-17T17:52:02Z

Stop Scrolling Social Media -> Download Deepstash -> Use it for 5 min/day -> Become the smartest in the room.

Join 3 Million+ smart people to discover new ideas, learn new things, improve yourself and inspire others.

Knowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.

Ideas are created by users just like you. Whenever you read a book, article or listen to a podcast and find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, you can add an idea about it in Deepstash. You see the source of the idea right in your feed.

What to do with ideas? They are fundamental to your wellbeing, success in life or your career. Ideas can make you:
- Smarter (you'll know more stuff, doh!)
- More Creative (you can connect more dots)
- Happier (better habits, less anxiety)

Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.

PERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS

Choose a few topics of interest and directions (like increasing productivity, building better habits or earning more money) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.

The more you read and save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.

BUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

You can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.

Search and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes.

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Add your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.

Share your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this.

Reading your notes 5 times feels like studying. It's not. Your brain goes ""yeah I recognize this"" when you see it again.

That's why Lexie exists. Photo of your textbook, instant practice. Fail now when it doesn't matter. 
Find what you don't know yet. Stop re-reading. Start retrieving. 

HOW LEXIE WORKS

Eskari-sovelluksen parissa lapsi pääsee loistamaan taidoillaan ja oppimaan uutta omalla tasollaan tavoitteellisesti ja hauskasti. Pikku Kakkosesta tuttu Reppu-Heppu ja hänen uudet eskarikaverinsa kannustavat leikkiin.

Pikku Kakkosen Eskarissa pelaillaan ja leikitään esiopetuksessakin eteen tulevien aiheiden parissa. Sisällöt on toteutettu niin, että lukutaidoton lapsi voi käyttää niitä itsenäisesti ja omaan tahtiin. Sovellus tulee täydentymään useilla erilaisilla sisältökokonaisuuksilla, joista ensimmäisenä on lukivalmiudet.

LUKIVALMIUDET

Niilo Mäki Instituutin kanssa yhteistyössä toteutetussa lukivalmiuksiin liittyvässä kokonaisuudessa pääset kirjainten maailmaan. Leikin kautta tutustutaan sanoihin, kirjainten ja äänteiden yhteyksiin ja tavuihin.

Big Ear Gamesin musiikkikokonaisuudessa pääset tuttujen laulujen avulla tutustumaan sävelasteikkoihin, rytmeihin, melodioihin ja harmoniaan. Sekvensserillä voi tehdä omaa musiikkia ja päästää luovuuden valloilleen.

MATEMATIIKKA

FT Jenni Vartiainen on toiminut pedagogisena asiantuntijana matematiikkakokonaisuudessa.  Peleissä pääset harjoittamaan hahmottamista ja kokeilemaan lajittelua, vertailua ja sarjoittelua sekä tutustumaan lukumääriin, numeromerkkeihin, hajotelmiin, lukujonoihin sekä yhteen- ja vähennyslaskuihin.
