START TRAVELLING

The VR Matkalla app is the best way to buy tickets for VR’s commuter and long-distance trains. The app offers single tickets, multi-tickets, and season tickets for regular travellers. Starting or continuing your journey in the capital region is easy! You can buy a handy HSL single ticket for your journey.

We will send your ticket to both the app and your email. You can pay for your journey using online banking, a payment card, MobilePay, Siirto or Epassi. If you have bought your tickets as a logged-in customer, you can always find the tickets you have bought in the app. This means that you can buy your ticket on your computer at home and still travel with that same ticket on your phone.

WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT?

You can conveniently reserve a seat using the coach map when buying a ticket. You can also buy the seat next to you and enjoy the extra space. If you want to add a touch of luxury to your journey, you can travel in Ekstra Class or the restaurant car’s upstairs section, which offers the best view. You can also buy a ticket for your travel companion, bicycle, or pet.

PLANS CAN CHANGE

Sometimes things don’t go as planned. In the VR Matkalla app, you can also make changes after buying the ticket. You can easily change your seat and departure time yourself. If needed, the change can be made to the tickets of the whole travel party. If you’ve bought cancellation insurance, you can also cancel your journey in the app for free if plans change.

WHERE ARE WE AT?

With the VR Matkalla app, you will get real-time updates about your journey, so you will always know what is happening. You will be informed about things like your train’s departure, the movement of the train, changed timetables, transfers, and your train’s arrival. You can also view your train’s services and accessibility information in the app. If we have to cancel your train journey, we will suggest new journeys in the app for you to choose from.

YOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW YOUR BENEFITS

For those who download the app, we offer tasty benefits that you can use in the train’s restaurant car. In addition, we will also tell you about changing benefits that will make your journey even better. You can find our tips and benefits in the Messages section of the VR Matkalla app.

We continuously develop our app. You can now also check the carbon footprint of the journeys you’ve taken in the past 12 months. Did you know that the carbon dioxide emissions of a train are 98% lower than those of a car?",2019-06-20T04:49:14Z,2025-11-20T09:01:12Z
