Forget boring family trees that end in names on a chart. We offer a tangible connection. Our technology renders a lifelike, era-authentic portrait of ancestors you’ve never met, capturing a plausible likeness with a strangely familiar face. It’s a jaw-dropping, shareable moment of connection when you see your own eyes, your smile, looking back at you from another time. This is the family photograph that was never taken.

But the portrait is just the beginning. It’s your entry point into a complete Ancestral Report, a deep dive into the elements that define your heritage.

First, discover your true origins with a detailed, percentage-based breakdown of your nationality. Go beyond continents to see the specific blend of cultures that make up your unique identity, revealing connections you never knew existed. Then, we reveal their story. Learn about the specific city your ancestors likely called home, the authentic craft they dedicated their lives to, and even the historical diet that fueled their world.

Your origin story doesn't just end in the past—it echoes in your present. The resilience of a frontiersman, the precision of an artisan, the creativity of a storyteller; these are more than historical facts, they are potential traits within you. We connect your heritage to your life today, offering unique insights for modern careers and lifestyles that may align with these ancestral strengths. It’s a powerful new way to understand your own passions and potential.

Join a growing community of people discovering themselves in a completely new way. The stories and portraits generated by EDNA are sparking conversations, connecting families, and helping people see their own identity in a richer, deeper light. It's a unique experience everyone is talking about.

This robust framework allows us to create a narrative that feels both magical and deeply plausible. We are committed to your privacy; your photo and personal data are always secure and are never shared.
