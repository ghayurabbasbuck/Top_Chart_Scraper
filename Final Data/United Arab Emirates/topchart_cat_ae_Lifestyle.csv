Unlike traditional budgeting tools, MoneyPro offers a reflective and mindful approach to personal finance. Each expense you log can be associated with a feeling, turning your financial records into a visual journal of mood and money habits. This allows you to track patterns over time, identify emotional triggers, and build healthier relationships with spending.

With MoneyPro, you can easily add expenses by selecting a category, amount, and optional note. Then, choose the emotion that best reflects how the purchase made you feel. Over time, you’ll see a color-coded emotional map of your financial decisions.

The app provides detailed analytics and insights, including balance overviews, mood trends, impulse control statistics, and a weekly summary that highlights positive behavior and areas for improvement. You can explore your spending patterns through a dedicated calendar view, review progress, and celebrate mindful growth.

MoneyPro is fully private by default. Your data is stored locally on your device, and no account is required.
