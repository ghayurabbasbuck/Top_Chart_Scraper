Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world!

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Leap into the fediverse
Threads is part of the fediverse, a global, open, social network of independent servers operated by third parties around the world. Servers share information with each other to enable people to connect and discover new things across the fediverse.

One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

Fill your life with movement. Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!

Choose the right service class for you
Reach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!

Ride safely
Safety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.

Smart destinations
Yango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!

Multiple destinations, one route
Yango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. 

Request rides for close ones
Show you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.

Refer friends and get discounts
Invite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.

Meet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages

We've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. 

An international service
Yango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.

Yango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.
