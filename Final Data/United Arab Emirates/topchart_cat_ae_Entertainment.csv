With the 'Joy Awards' App, it's you who will nominate and vote for your beloved stars and releases in Music, Cinema, Series, Directors, Sports, and Influencers, all for free!



You will nominate and cast your votes in two phases:




First Phase: Nominating Your Favorite Stars and Releases
In the nomination phase, which lasts for one month, you play a crucial role in shaping the competition. 
Here's where YOU come in – choose your favorite nominee from the names or titles listed in each category. If your top pick isn't there, don't worry! You have the chance to add your own favorite name or title, as long as it meets the terms and conditions: it should be a release or achievement from 2025. 
During the nomination phase, you can nominate only once for each category.
This phase eventually leads to the selection of the top four final nominees in each category, representing the stars and releases with the most nominations.
 
Second Phase: Voting for Your Favorite Stars and Releases
After the nominations have been counted, the voting phase begins with the top four nominees in each category, which also spans one month.
Here's where YOU make the difference – cast your votes for your favorite nominees. 
And a month later, the voting counts are gathered, leading to the grand reveal of the winners during the live ""Joy Awards 2026"" ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
During the voting phase, you can vote only once for each category.",2021-10-17T07:00:00Z,2025-11-18T10:53:08Z
