Map, navigator, public transport, guidebook and directory – all one icon away in your phone. It will show your location, find a required address, help you to plot your route by car, bus, bicycle or by foot. And then you can see your friends right on the map in 2GIS!

The app is free and it works both online and offline – just download the required city or even a region and use maps without Internet connection.

GPS navigation. Get ready to see precisely depicted roads with tunnels and multi-level junctions in 3D. 2GIS will build an optimal route providing for traffic jam, road accidents and roads under construction. It will show your speed so that you don’t have to glance at speed meter too often. It will give you a warning of speed and other cameras ahead so that you can avoid getting a ticket. It will show you the nearest parking lots. The app combines different technologies to make route following more precise, even on long-distance travels without Internet connection. Turn on 2GIS in Apple CarPlay — it’s free.

Maps maxed out. 2GIS is detailed maps of more than 1400 cities: with realistic models of buildings, neighborhoods, roads, bus stops – even trees in a park and entrances to buildings are shown! Floor-by-floor layouts are available for malls, train and bus stations, airports and other complex buildings – you will not get lost! As well as layers with real estate, car sharing and other useful services.

Public transport. Build routes by subway, bus, trolley or commuter train. Choose the shortest ones or the most convenient ones, with or without change of transport. Turn on bus tracking on the map in real time. Go by the schedule and see credible estimated time of bus arrival to your bus stop.

Navigator for pedestrians, bicycles and scooters. 2GIS can build routes through a city providing for inclinations and elevations, cycle lanes and stairs. It is particularly convenient for scooter riders or people walking with strollers. 

Friends on the Map. Add your friends and family members as Friends in 2GIS to see each other on the map in the city in real time! No need to ask, “Where are you?”, just check location on the map. It makes meeting planning easier (especially if someone is running late) or allows for spontaneous meetings! Send an emoji to a friend to offer a meeting or start conversation in chat without a need to switch to a messenger.

You can also send a link to your location or route to any person, not just friends. And even create temporary groups for travels. Manage who can see your location. It is convenient, private and helps you to always stay in touch.

This function may be used as a family location finder: add your child or grandmother and grandfather to Friends and you will not have to worry if they don’t respond in a messenger. You will get an automatic push notification when your relative is at home.

Everything about the city. In 2GIS search, you will find contact details of companies and organizations, addresses, business hours, restaurant menus, information on products and services, and even pictures with prices. All information is updated regularly.

Reviews. 2GIS not only helps you to find companies, products and services, but also to choose the best of the best! The app stores tens of thousands of reviews, real photos from customers and honest rating of a place.

Guidebooks. Discover interesting places just for you in any city! Includes original selections, audio guides and sightseeing attractions in 3D.

Navigator for trucks. Cargo navigator gets directions for trucks considering the individual characteristics of vehicles and cargo.

The Apple Watch companion app conveys a map and a route created using your phone on your watch screen, and also shows your current location. Vibration will alert you when you need to turn. The Friends on the map widget on the main screen will keep you informed of your loved ones' whereabouts.

With our GPS-powered app, you can see your precise location and plan routes straight to your destination in Dubai, Baku, and many other cities. The app shows you directions that avoid traffic, up-to-date bus schedules, and knows all those fast, easy walking routes that take you around obstacles. The interface and voice navigation prompts support several languages, including English and Arabic.

With Yango Maps, you get a stress-free driving experience with real-time updates on the road and clear instructions on how to navigate complex intersections. In Dubai, the map displays the roads in high detail complete with all their lane markings, multi-level interchanges, tunnels, traffic lights, parking spots, and more. You'll get warnings about upcoming traffic, road closures, and speed limits ahead of time so you'll definitely get there on schedule. 

The app also directs you straight to convenient parking and drop-off locations near your destination so that nothing stands between you and the places you need to go. To add to that, the navigator works even without an internet connection — simply download a map of the city to search for organizations and get driving directions even offline.

If you're not in the driving seat, you can book a ride through the built-in Yango ride-hailing service, find out when your bus is scheduled, and get a streamlined walking route so you can get to the desired location with ease.

In another step toward an enhanced navigation experience, Yango Maps displays iconic Dubai landmarks in full-color 3D, including Burj Khalifa, Dubai Frame, the Museum of The Future, and the Jumeirah Mosque. Switching to dark mode triggers lifelike lighting effects on the 3D models right on the map, realistically replicating the city’s evening ambience.

Yango Maps is also available in CarPlay, so you can see your route laid out in front of you as you drive. This currently works in the UAE and Azerbaijan, and we'll add support for more locations in upcoming updates.

Download Yango Maps — and feel truly free to explore.
