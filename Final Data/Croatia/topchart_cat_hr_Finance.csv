Duguješ nekome za ručak? Netko tebi duguje za karte za kino? Besplatno skini KEKS Pay i olakšaj si život. Uživaj u slatkim transakcijama već danas!

Svi su dobrodošli
Iako je KEKS Pay aplikacija Erste banke, možeš je koristiti neovisno o tome u kojoj banci ti ili tvoji frendovi imate račun bez da pritom plaćaš ikakve naknade za prijenos novca.

Stvarno brzo i jednostavno
Skini i instaliraj aplikaciju u svega 2 minute, a onda šalji ili zatraži lovu od frendova. Podatke za primanje i slanje love trebaš upisati samo jednom, a od frenda nijednom. Da bi mu poslao lovu, dovoljno je da imaš njegov broj mobitela. Da, dobro si shvatio - nema više zamornog upisivanja dugačkih brojeva i šifri!

Podijeli troškove
Želiš s frendovima skupiti lovu za rođendanski poklon, ali ne želiš voditi evidenciju plaćanja i boriti se s gotovinom? KEKS Pay je pravo rješenje za tebe! Više ne moraš brinuti jesu li svi platili i vući lovu naokolo. Kreiraj chat grupu, pozovi ekipu da se sve lijepo dogovorite i jednostavno prati uplate putem mobitela.

Pozovi frenda
Lovu možeš poslati i nekome tko nema KEKS Pay. On će dobiti SMS s uputama za preuzimanje aplikacije, a potom i tvoje uplate, u samo nekoliko klikova. Baš kao što si ti već učinio, i on će upisati IBAN na koji želi primati uplate. U slučaju da ne preuzme aplikaciju u roku od 5 dana, tebi će lova biti pošteno vraćena.

Sigurnost prije svega
Što se tiče sigurnosti, tu nemaš nikakvog razloga za brigu - brojevi kartica nisu zapisani na mobitelu, sve je kriptirano i spremljeno na zaštićenim serverima do kojih nitko ne može doći (u skladu s regulativom PCI DSS), a aplikacija je zaštićena PIN-om ili biometrijom (otisak prsta i ostale opcije).

Mobilna aplikacija mPorezna povećava dostupnost elektroničkih usluga Ministarstva financija - Porezne uprave poreznim obveznicima te smanjuje troškove ispunjavanja poreznih obveza.

Aplikacija je razvijena u sklopu projekta „Povezivanje i unaprjeđenje aplikativnih rješenja unutar Informacijskog sustava Porezne uprave i razvoj mPorezne“ sufinanciranog od Europske unije iz Europskog socijalnog fonda.

Porezni obveznici koji su korisnici mobilnih uređaja mogu kroz mobilnu aplikaciju ostvariti uvid u svoje podatke, zaprimljene poruke i porezne akte, mogu podnositi zahtjeve, dobiti važne informacije o svojim poreznim obvezama i poslati upit Poreznoj upravi koji se tiče sustava ePorezna i mPorezna.

Porezni obveznici putem aplikacije mogu vidjeti i stanje na porezno knjigovodstvenoj kartici (PKK), preuzeti 2D barkod za provođenje plaćanja, pregledati detalje podnesenih obrazaca i zahtjeva, provjeriti obavijesti i rokove podnošenja obrazaca kroz personalizirani porezni kalendar, mogu podnijeti zahtjev za izmjenom podataka na poreznoj kartici (PK), zahtjev za izdavanje potvrde o stanju duga, zahtjev za izmjenom podataka u Registru poreznih obveznika, informativno izračunati podatke o plaći putem usluge kalkulatora za izračun plaće, direktno se obratiti Poreznoj upravi putem servisa „Pišite nam“ te anonimno prijaviti porezni i drugi prekršaj.

Također, poreznim obveznicima omogućen je  uvid u podatke iz JOPPD obrasca (Izvješće o primicima, porezu na dohodak i prirezu te doprinosima za obvezna osiguranja) za korisnika usluge, Uvid u IP1/IP2 - uvid u podatke o plaći, mirovini, doprinosima, porezu i prirezu koji ulaze u godišnji obračun (obračunati i isplaćeni primici) i Uvid u IP3 - uvid u podatke o plaći, mirovini, doprinosima, porezu i prirezu koji ne ulaze u godišnji obračun.

Funkcionalnosti su prilagođene radu na manjim ekranima kako bi iskustvo korištenja bilo optimalno uz mogućnost podešavanja veličine slova i boje ekrana. Za korištenje aplikacije potrebno se prijaviti putem Nacionalnog identifikacijskog i autentifikacijskog sustava (NIAS) koristeći jednu od priznatih vjerodajnica NIAS sustava. Za prijavu u aplikaciju potrebno je posjedovati valjanu NIAS vjerodajnicu značajne ili niske razine sigurnosti: značajna razina sigurnosti uključuje na primjer mToken, Fina Soft certifikat, token/mtoken uređaje banaka koji su povezani sa sustavom NIAS dok niska razina sigurnosti uključuje ePass, ePošta, AAI@EduHr korisničko ime i lozinku, HT Telekom ID.

Strateški cilj Porezne uprave je dvostrana elektronička komunikacija Porezne uprave i poreznih obveznika, stoga je uspostava elektroničkih usluga na mobilnim platformama značajan korak u širenju kruga korisnika i proširenja dostupnosti elektroničkih usluga Porezne uprave poreznim obveznicima. U sklopu ovog projekta razvijene su nove funkcionalnosti sustava ePorezna kroz uspostavu krovne mobilne aplikacije mPorezna unutar koje će se kroz funkcije mobilnih aplikacija omogućiti povećanje dostupnosti elektroničkih usluga Porezne uprave građanima i poduzetnicima.

Sadržaj mobilne aplikacije isključiva je odgovornost Ministarstva financija – Porezne uprave, a razvijena je od tvrtke APIS IT d.o.o.",2022-05-24T07:00:00Z,2025-10-18T07:40:09Z
