Benable is the all-in-one platform to share your favorite: products, places, activities, services, videos, recipes, and more!


THE RECOMMENDATION APP FOR EVERYONE

• Create lists of anything you love
• Discover millions of trusted recs
• Earn commission from 35,000+ brands 

HOW DOES IT WORK?
When you join Benable, you create beautiful shareable lists of things you love. Adding recommendations is super easy! You just add the name or link of your rec (e.g. a restaurant, a book, a product, etc.) and Benable will pull in all the info automatically to make a beautiful recommendation card - photos, links, and more!

HOW DO I SHARE MY LISTS?
Tap to share the link to your Benable profile and lists anywhere you want! Simply copy the link and send it to a friend, paste it in your bio, or add it to your blog. Your recs and profile can be viewed by anyone - people don’t need a Benable account.

WILL BENABLE HELP SPREAD MY CONTENT?
Yes! On the Discover pages, Trending page, in search results, and in people’s feeds. You’ll get frequent updates on what the Benable algorithm is looking for, and as you improve your Benable lists they’ll trend more and more across the platform and through SEO on the web. Over 1 million people browse Benable every month looking for trusted recommendations, and the Benable algorithm optimizes feeds for each person’s tastes!

35,000+ BRAND PARTNERS?
Yep! Benable has partnered with the world's biggest brands to help you monetize your recommendations. You get instant access to those brand partnerships as soon as you join! Whenever you add recommendations to your Benable lists, your recs will automatically be affiliate-linked. That means that whenever someone makes a purchase from your Benable lists, the brand partner will pay you a commission! Benable doesn't take a cent, you keep the full commission! You can then cash out on Venmo, Paypal, etc.

IS BENABLE JUST FOR PRODUCTS THEN?
Nope! You can literally recommend anything: restaurants you love, travel recs, articles, activities, resources, recipes, etc. If your recommendation is from a brand partner (e.g. product, hotel, etc) then it’ll get an affiliate link, but you can still recommend everything else!

HOW MUCH DOES BENABLE COST?
Benable is totally free! 

BENABLE IS ALL ABOUT AUTHENTICITY!
