What are you waiting for? Activate your location and we’ll activate your taste buds! You set the tone, we set the table.

TheFork continues to be savoured across the biggest foodie hotspots in France, Spain, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden. But wait, what exactly do we bring to the table? Here are 6 reasons to download TheFork app right now.

1. Things that tickle our taste buds: fast, free and easy online booking
We know that normal life means having a lot on your plate, so to make things a bit easier for you, we've simplified restaurant booking. With a few simple taps on our mobile app, you’ll be one step closer to having that ‘mmm’ moment of pure belly satisfaction, in the most seamless way possible.

2. Frugal on prices, never on flavours
Our amazing restaurant partners love their diners as much as we love ours and offer exclusive discounts on reservations throughout the year (automatically applied and subject to conditions at the time of booking). That way restaurants get to open their doors to all types of diners, making dining out accessible to everyone.

3. Community insights = better bites
Tuck into the wisdom of our gourmet community! With over 20 million trusted reviews from only customers who have actually tried the restaurant—your palette is in good hands!

4. We don’t skimp on choice
Reserved? Not us. That’s just a label for a table. So whether you’re looking for the perfect spot for bottomless brunching, taco crunching or al-fresco munching, our foodies are spoiled for choice with our diverse collection of over 60,000 restaurants and 40,000 photos, menus and community reviews that will satisfy just about any culinary mood and occasion. After all, variety is the spice of life! Browse, scroll and add to favourites, so you can find more of what you love. Now that’s food for thought.

5. We take loyalty VERY seriously
To reward our awesome foodie community, every booking with TheFork accumulates unique Yums points, which can be redeemed in the form of a tasty discount at one of our many partner restaurants down the line. Here’s how it works:

1 reservation = 100 Yums (Y)

Once you've accumulated enough you can enjoy amazing offers which converts to: 
1000 Yums = £20 loyalty discount!
2000 Yums = £50 loyalty discount!

Keep an eye out for Double Yums and other ways to earn more Yums as you book.

We love hearing from our TheFork foodie community! Reach out at contact@thefork.com.
