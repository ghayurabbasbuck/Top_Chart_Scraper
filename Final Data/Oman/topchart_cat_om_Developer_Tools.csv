Automatic Subscription Service Rules

1. If you subscribe to the automatic renewal service through your Apple ID and do not actively cancel the automatic subscription service during the subscription period, Hodor will automatically deduct the next subscription fee from the balance of the Apple ID account linked to the automatic renewal service 24 hours before the current subscription period expires (subject to the actual Apple billing rules). You should pay attention to the balance and payment status of the account. If the renewal fails due to account issues or insufficient balance, you will bear the risk and/or loss by yourself. For your convenience, Apple will notify you of the upcoming deduction before processing the payment. It is important to note that based on the nature of the automatic renewal service, if you do not explicitly cancel the automatic renewal service during the subscription period, Apple will issue a deduction instruction to the relevant parties based on your permission. Generally, any fees deducted based on this instruction will not be refunded.

2. Hodor Pro Subscription Period: 1 year.

3. Hodor reserves the right to adjust service prices or stop providing automatic renewal services. If you do not agree with the adjusted service price, you can cancel the automatic renewal service according to these rules. If you do not cancel the automatic renewal service, the subsequent fees deducted by Apple will be adjusted to the new service fee.

4. The method to cancel the automatic subscription service is as follows: open the Apple iOS device ""App Store"" -> click on the Apple account profile picture in the upper-right corner -> enter ""Account"" -> click on ""Subscriptions"" -> select ""Hodor"" -> cancel the subscription.

5. Hodor may stop providing you with automatic renewal services according to operational needs. Your Hodor service period will end on the date of the expiry of the current service cycle.
