Reverso is the best tool for those who seek quality translation, looking to master a foreign language: reading, writing or speaking, and it's free.

It provides you instant translations of the selected text when reading content on your browser, on Safari or any other app.
 
Reverso Context is based on data gathered from millions of real-life texts (official documents, movie subtitles, product descriptions) in both languages. These texts are processed with powerful ""big data"" algorithms and machine learning to provide you the best results.

Just type or say the word or expression you wish to translate and the results will appear instantly:  relevant translations, presented with examples of how words are used in sentences.

The app offers flashcards and quizzes based on your search history and favorites to help you memorize them and to improve your language skills. Unlike standard learning tools, it focuses on words and expressions that you really need and want to learn.

The bits and bytes: 
* Instantly translate selected text when reading content on your browser, iBook or any other app, with no need to exit the app you are using. Click on the familiar ""Share"" option and select the Reverso option.
