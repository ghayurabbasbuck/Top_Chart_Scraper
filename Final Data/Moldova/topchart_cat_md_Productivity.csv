Create images and AI video—Yandex ART generates visuals or animates photos on request. Alice helps you produce striking social posts, a logo, or a birthday card.

Use AI chat for professional work. The assistant helps with programming and code, offering multiple solution approaches. Alice AI teaches logic, explains logical problems clearly, and shares interesting facts. Get advice and recommendations on any topic—Alice answers in detail, suggests step-by-step actions, and helps you plan.
