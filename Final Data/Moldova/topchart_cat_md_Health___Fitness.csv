▶ RISE Premium Features

FEEL BETTER
Are you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. 

Sleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.

With Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. 

GUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU
Do you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? 

Based on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. 

How Rise helps you sleep better:
Encourages you to get into bed on time 
Provides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping 
Reduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night 
Optimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess

OPTIMIZE YOUR DAY
We all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. 

AUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP
Through our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.

In the fast-paced modern life, health management is often ""squeezed out"" by busyness—you can’t find paper and pen when you want to record your blood pressure, lack systematic data when you want to analyze blood glucose changes, and have no way to integrate multiple health indicators. To help you break through these troubles, VitalTide APP comes into being. It integrates the recording of multi-dimensional health indicators such as blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate, and serves as your reliable health partner that you can rely on at any time with simple operations and clear data presentation.

● Blood Pressure Recording: Adapted to Daily Monitoring Scenarios  
Whether it is the basic blood pressure measurement after getting up in the morning, or irregular monitoring during work breaks, after exercise, etc., the APP has a convenient recording entrance. You can quickly save the data by manually entering the measured values, no complicated operations are required, and it is easy to track the fluctuation trend of blood pressure.
● Blood Glucose Recording: Distinguish Scenarios to Facilitate Diet Analysis  
For blood glucose management needs, an intuitive and easy-to-use dedicated interface is designed: it supports distinguishing between ""pre-meal"" and ""post-meal"" records to help you clearly sort out the correlation between diet and blood glucose changes.
2. Multi-Dimensional Coverage: Meet the Needs of Comprehensive Health Management
In addition to blood pressure and blood glucose, the APP also supports the recording of basic indicators such as heart rate, height and weight, and is also equipped with reference for healthy diet guidelines—from basic physiological data to daily diet suggestions, it covers your health management needs in one stop, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools.

Now you have an assistant on your journey to mindful parenting – trusted by 1,000,000+ moms and dads! Grow Together. Every Step of the Way.

GROWTH CRISES CALENDAR
From birth up to 2 years, a child goes through several growth and development crises. There's no need to be worried – this is a natural process during which the nervous system and brain develop, and the baby acquires new skills. However, during such periods, a child might become fussy and sleep poorly.

We display growth crises in the calendar so you won't worry: together with pediatricians we explain what's happening with the physiology, motor skills, and speech development of your child up to 105 weeks inclusive.

MEASUREMENTS OF HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CIRCUMFERENCES
Fix key child's growth parameters – and track how they change. Check them with the World Health Organization's standards. 

TRACKERS FOR SLEEP, FEEDING, DIAPER CHANGES, PUMPING, AND CHILD'S MOOD
Record all the important information about your child's daily schedule and routine – all in one app.

230+ DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY
Tiger on a Branch, Maracas, More Noise, Miracles – these are not the titles of colorful children's cartoons, but engaging developmental exercises that you can perform with your child every day.

JOURNAL OF PRECIOUS MOMENTS
The first smile of your little one, the first tooth, the momentous first step – keep lovely memories not just in your heart. Record them in the app to create a cute video and share it on social media and messengers with family and friends. 

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

The subscription provides access to additional services in the app, becoming your daily go-to parenting resource.

- A set of exercises for each day. They match the stage of your baby's development and don't take much time. The checklist format makes it easy to keep track of completed exercises.
- Developmental norms: cognitive and psychological, speech and motor skills, teething. Checked by pediatricians and approved by the World Health Organization.

Additional information:

- Payment will be charged to your Apple account after purchase confirmation. You could check the available subscription options in the app after its installation.

Hello! My name is Dima, I am the father of a wonderful girl, Elli. 

When she was born, my whole world turned upside down. I learned about growth crises challenging for both the child and parents. To keep track of them, I created this app. Suddenly other parents started using it too. Today, thousands of moms and dads monitor their child's development with us – it's so inspiring, I'm so grateful. Thank you!
