It helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.

No surprises on the road
Get detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. 
It also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.

Get multi-stop directions
There’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.
Plan a route with 4-10 stops and tap ""Optimize."" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.

Get your bearings anywhere 
No matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.

Never get lost offline
Find places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.

Pay for parking 
Look for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.

Pay for fuel
Choose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.

Steer clear of poor road conditions
Turn on ""Avoid bad and unpaved roads"" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.

Plan your trips ahead of time
Adjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.
For example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.

Get directions tailored to your vehicle
If you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select ""Add truck"" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.

Monitor traffic in real time
Yandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.

See your route laid out in front of you 
Yandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.

The app works in Russia, Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.

How it is working:

• User A wants to know a User B location.

• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.

• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.

• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.

Limitations:

• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.

• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).

• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.

The user location is determined in three ways:

Metro map. Choose routes taking into account changes in the work of the metro, MCC, MCC and BCL – the application will tell you the time of arrival of the train and a convenient car for the transfer. Do you want to know the train schedule of the MCC and MCC? View the schedule by clicking on the desired station. Do you need the shortest and fastest route or with a minimum of transfers? The application will do everything for you – just specify your preferences in the settings, the algorithm will select the best option.

Replenishment of the balance. Top up your card at any time, and the tips in the app will help you choose a convenient way to record: in a ticket vending machine, a yellow terminal in the subway or on a validator in ground transport.

Personal account. A huge number of services are collected here: card binding, payment by biometrics, Multitransport subscription, purchase of tickets for intercity buses. And what else is there – see in the app!

Transfer of balance. Now it's not a big deal to lose the linked ""Troika"" – just transfer the balance to a new card, having previously linked it to the cabinet.

Payment by biometrics. The plastic world has won, and we have created a service for contactless fare payment – you no longer need to carry extra cards with you. Take a selfie, link a bank or social card and pass through the turnstile by looking into the camera lens.

History. Have you forgotten what purchases you made? Open the history, find the operation you need and download the receipt.

Multitransport. From home to any point – in one click! We have combined the most popular destinations – now in one application you can buy ""One"", order ""Yandex.Taxi"" or choose Yandex. Subscriptions.Scooters"" and ""Bike.

Intercity buses. We are not limited to Moscow – for long-distance travel, use the Intercity Buses service: add passengers and buy a ticket. The digital ticket will be available in your orders immediately after purchase, and if you suddenly change your mind, you can also return the ticket here.

News. It contains the most up-to-date information about all changes in the work of the metro.

Request for support. Need help on the way? Create an application for escort, specifying the meeting place and destination, and our employees of the Passenger Mobility Center (TSOMP) will do the rest.
