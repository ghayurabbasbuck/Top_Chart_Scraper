Spice up your imagination with a juicy collection of stories that will take you to explore your deepest fantasies. From tender romantic novels to the most secret taboos, one can dream of. The choice is yours.

- Join our community and indulge in your inner desires with original stories curated by the best authors for steamy stories. The stories are added on a daily basis.

- Choose from a huge variety of genres including Romance, Adult, LGBTQ+, Paranormal, First Time, Mature, BDSM, Interracial Love, or Thriller, and more!

- Discover an extra layer of sensuality and treat yourself with steamy audio stories. In addition to a personalized experience, you will find that audio stories can help you relieve stress, nurture intimacy, and increase arousal.

Wondering what kind of stories we might bring you? Let's take a sneak peek at a couple.

-- I gulped and straightened up, blushing and feeling hot under her intense gaze. June Watson. The one girl I’ve always had a crush on. Heck, there was no counting the number of dreams I’ve had about her, and all the things I’ve fantasized about us doing.

-- When Amber's mother announced that she would remarry, Amber knew her feelings for James, her future stepfather, were inappropriate. She tried to push her fantasies to older students at the college, but none of them ever seemed to satisfy her. Maybe it was the lack of a father figure in her life, but she was drawn to James almost immediately.

-- The game went on, fired up with wild dares and barely a sprinkle of truths. So far, no one’s tried to escape their dares, Jamie noticed as he watched Sasha and Ava kneel and face each other. Sasha had been dared to make out with someone - she’d picked randomly from pieces of paper with all their names on them.

Important Note:

● The Hadiths included in the App are in Arabic & English Language ONLY. Although we would love to add more languages, we don't have the required hadith databases for other languages.

● We also feel compelled to make an observation here: this is not a fiqh or fatwa application. Hadith are made available on this application as a resource for research, personal study, and understanding. The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings. We do not advocate do-it-yourself fiqh using these hadith for those who are untrained in these principles. If you have a question on a specific ruling, please ask your local scholar.",2020-07-14T07:00:00Z,2025-03-19T09:16:59Z
