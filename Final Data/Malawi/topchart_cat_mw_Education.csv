This powerful AI checker for iOS helps you analyze any text with high accuracy and instantly Humanize AI content with its built-in AI Humanizer.

WHY DOES THIS AI DETECTOR STAND OUT?

Many apps promise accurate results, but this AI Detector is built to give users a quick, reliable, and simple experience. 
The AI detector uses advanced models to check AI content and highlight artificial patterns that other tools often miss. 

Once your content is checked, you can use the AI text humanizer to rewrite and reword your text in a natural and clear style.

This makes it perfect for students, creators, professionals, and anyone who wants authentic writing.

MAIN FEATURES OF OUR AI DETECTOR AND AI HUMANIZER
Check out the features that make our app better than overrated utilities:

- Improve clarity without losing ideas

Our AI text humanizer focuses on natural tone, readability, and smooth sentence structure, making the output more lifelike compared to other apps.

DUAL POWER IN ONE APP

Unlike most tools, this app gives you both an advanced AI checker and a high-quality AI Humanizer in one place. You can check AI content, fix it, rewrite it, and humanize it all without switching apps.

This saves time and ensures an easy experience.

PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY USE

You can use this AI detector app if you need to:

- Check AI content in academic work.
- Rewrite or reword writing for clarity.
- Humanize AI text for blogs or social posts.
- Improve messaging for emails or business writing.
- Make your content look fully human-written.

SIMPLE, FAST, AND USER FRIENDLY

You do not need any technical background to use it. The clean layout guides you step by step, making the process smooth from start to finish. Just paste your text, tap Check AI, and the AI Detector shows instant results with clear explanations.

After that, you can use the AI Text Humanizer to rewrite, reword, and Humanize AI content in a single tap. Every feature loads quickly, and every tool is placed where you can find it easily. 

This simple and fast setup helps you stay focused on creating high-quality, natural, and human-sounding writing without wasting time.

WHY OUR AI DETECTOR IS BETTER THAN OTHERS?

- More accurate detection than typical AI checker apps
- Stronger NLP-powered rewriting engine for natural language
- All-in-one AI Detector and Humanizer
- Improved reword system for smooth and readable output
- Trusted technology that keeps your content private

SUBSCRIPTION TERMS
