The application uses a database of points filled with love by other users.

Find your country or region from the list, and you're good to go! You will see all the alerts on the map.
Turn on the detection, and the application will warn you when something on the way is about to spoil your day.
Not interested in some types of hazards? Filter them out on the preferences page.
Contribute! Rate down the hazard if you hadn't seen it or thumbs up if it's on the place. We will remove threats with low ratings as invalid.
Add you're highly welcome to add your own points if they are not in the database.

Be careful on the road and good luck!

The workflow of the application differs from the hardware radar detector. Hardware radar detector - is a passive receiver that does not block the signal to which it is set, but simply notify the driver of the presence in the field of the radar radio interference.
This application works differently: it uses a database of hazards previously detected by other users.",2017-07-07T09:57:36Z,2025-05-04T07:37:12Z
